<p>The original Serbo-Croat names of the Dalmatian
towns and islands have been commonly supplanted on
the German-made maps by later Italian names. But
as the older ones are those which are at present used in
daily speech by the vast majority of the inhabitants, we
shall not be accused of pedanticism or of political bias
if we prefer them to the later versions. We therefore
in this book do not speak of Fiume but of Rieka, not of
Cattaro but of Kotor, and so forth. In other parts a
greater laxity is permissible, since no false impression is
conveyed by using the non-Slav version. Thus we have
preferred the more habitual Belgrade to the more correct
Beograd, and the Italian Scutari to the Albanian Shqodra.
The Yugoslavs themselves are too deferential towards
the foreign nomenclature of their towns. Thus if one of
them is talking to you of Novi Sad he will almost invariably
add, until it grows rather wearisome, the German
and the Magyar forms: Neu Satz and Uj Videk.</p>

<p>These names and those of persons have been generally
spelt in accordance with Croat orthography&mdash;that is to
say, with the Latin alphabet modified in order to reproduce
all the sounds of the Serbo-Croatian language.
This script, with its diacritic marks, was scientifically
evolved at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The
chief points about it that we have to remember are that
c is pronounced as if written ts, &#263; as if written tch, &#269; is
pronounced ch, &#353; is pronounced sh, and j is pronounced
y. So the Montenegrin towns Cetinje, Podgorica and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Nik&#353;i&#263; are pronounced as if written Tsetinye, Podgoritsa
and Nikshitch, while Pan&#269;evo is pronounced Panchevo.
It will be seen that this matter is not very complicated.
But we have not in every case employed the Croat script.
We have not spoken in this book of Jugoslavia but of
Yugoslavia, since that has come to be the more familiar
form.</p>

<p>The full list of Croat letters, in so far as they differ
from the English alphabet, is as follows:</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></h2>


<p>On a mild February afternoon I was waiting for the
train at a wayside station in north-western Banat. So
unimportant was that station that it was connected neither
by telegraph nor telephone with any other station, and
thus there was no means of knowing how long I would
have to wait. The movements of the train in those parts
could never, so I gathered, be foretold, and on that afternoon
it was uncertain whether a strike had prevented
it from leaving New-Arad, the starting-point. Occasionally
the rather elegant stationmaster, and occasionally
the porter with the round, disarming face, raised their
voices in prophecy, but they were increasingly unable&mdash;so
far, at least, as I was concerned&mdash;to modify the feelings
of dullness that were caused by the circumstances and by
the dreary nature of the surroundings: a plain with
several uninteresting little lakes upon it. There was time
enough for meditation&mdash;I was wondering if I would ever
understand the people of the Balkans. One hour and
then another slipped away, and the lakes began to be
illuminated by the setting sun. A handful of prospective
travellers and their friends were also waiting, and as
one of them produced a violin we all began to dance the
Serbian Kolo, which is performed by an indefinite number
of people who have to be hand-in-hand, irrespective of
sex, forming in this way a straight line or a circle or a
serpent-like series of curves. They go through certain
simple evolutions, into which more or less energy and
sprightliness are introduced. The stationmaster looked
on approvingly and then decided to join us, and after
a little time he was followed by the porter. Our violinist
was in excellent form, so that we continued dancing until
some of us were as crimson as the sun, and presently,
while I was resting, what with the beauty of the scene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and the exhilaration of the dance, I found myself thinking
that, after all, I might within a reasonable time understand
these people. Then a new arrival, a middle-aged,
benevolent-looking woman with a basket on her arm, came
past me.</p>

<p>"Dobro ve&#269;e," said I. ["Good-evening."]</p>

<p>"&#381;ivio," said she. ["May you live long."]</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I hope in this book to give a description
of how the Yugoslavs, brothers and neighbours and
tragically separated from one another for so many
centuries, made various efforts to unite, at least in some
degree. But for about fifteen centuries the greater
number of Yugoslavs were unable to liberate themselves
from their alien rulers; not until the end of the Great
War were these dominations overthrown, and the kindred
peoples, the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, put at last before
the realization of their dreams&mdash;the dreams, that is to
say, of some of their poets and statesmen and bishops
and philologists, as well as of certain foreigners. But
listen to this, by the censorious literateur who contributes
the "Musings without Method" to <i>Maga</i>: "We
do not envy the ingenious gentlemen," says he, "who
invented the two new States Czecho-Slovakia and Jugo-Slavia.
Their composite names prove their composite
characters. That they will last long beneath the fanciful
masks which have been put upon them we do not believe."
Even so might some uninstructed person in Yugoslavia
or South Slavia proceed to wash his hands of that ingenious
man who invented <i>Maga's</i> home, North Britain.
I see that our friend in the following number of <i>Maga</i>
(March 1920) says that foreign affairs are "a province
far beyond his powers or understanding." But he is
talking of Mr. Lloyd George.</p>

<p>Our account of medi&aelig;val times will be brief, only so
much in fact as is needed for a comprehension of the
present. In approaching our own day, the story will
become more and more detailed. If it be objected that
the details, in so far as they detract from the conduct of
Yugoslavia's neighbours, might with advantage have been
painted with the hazy, quiet colours that you give to the
excursions and alarms of long ago, one may reply that this
book is intended to depict the world in which the Yugoslavs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
have, after all these centuries, joined one another
and the frame of mind which consequently glows in
them.</p>

<p>One cannot on this earth expect that a new State,
however belated and however inevitable, will be formed
without a considerable amount of friction, both external
and internal. Perhaps, owing to the number of not over-friendly
States with which they are encompassed, the
Yugoslavs will manage to waive some of their internal
differences, and to show that they are capable, despite
the confident assertions of some of their neighbours and
the croakings of some of themselves, of establishing a
State that will weather for many a year the storms which
even the League of Nations may not be competent to
banish from South-Eastern Europe. A certain number
of people, who seem to expect us to take them seriously,
assert that an English writer is disqualified from passing
adverse comment on Italy's imperialistic aims because
the British Empire has received, as a result of the War,
some Turkish provinces and German colonies. It is
said that, in view of these notorious facts, the Italian
Nationalists and their friends cannot bear to be criticized
by the pens of British authors and journalists. The
fallacy in logic known as the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>
becomes a pale thing in comparison with this new <i>argumentum
ad terram</i>. If a passionless historian of the
Eskimos had given his attention to the Adriatic, I believe
he would have come to my conclusions. But then it
might be said of him that as for half the year his land is
swathed in darkness, it would be unseemly for him to
discuss a country which is basking in the sun.</p>

<p>Another consummation&mdash;though this will to-day find,
especially in Serbia, a great many opponents, whose
attitude, following the deplorable events of the Great
War, can cause us no surprise&mdash;is the adhesion, after
certain years, of Bulgaria to the Yugoslav State. I
wrote these words a few months ago; they are already
out of date. The general opinion in Serbia is voiced by
a Serbian war-widow, who, writing in <i>Politika</i>, one of
the newspapers of Belgrade, replied to Stamboul&uuml;sky, the
Bulgarian peasant Premier, who was always uncompromisingly
opposed to the fratricidal war with Serbia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
He had been saying that the Serbs and other Yugoslavs
prefer to postpone the reconciliation until "the grass
grows over the graves of their women and children whom
our officials destroyed"; and this war-widow answered
that it was not necessary for the grass to grow, but that
they should condemn the culprits by a regular court, as
prescribed in the treaty. "Fulfil the undertaking you
have assumed, for only so shall we know that you will
fulfil other undertakings in the future." If it had not
been for the Great Powers, especially Russia and Austria,
the union of Serbia and Bulgaria might have occurred
long ago. Wise persons, such as Prince Michael of
Serbia and the British travellers, Miss Irby (Bosnia's
lifelong benefactress) and her relative, Miss Muir Mackenzie,
had this aim in view during the sixties of last
century. So had a number of other excellent folk, who
recognized that the two people were naturally drawn to
one another. "The hatred between the two people is
a fact which is as saddening in the thought for the future
as in the record of the past, but it is a fact to ignore which
is simply a mark of incompetence. The two nations
are antipathetic ..." says Mr. A.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;E. Taylor in his
<i>The Future of the Southern Slavs</i>, a painstaking if rather
clumsy book (London, 1917), in which we are shown
that the writer is well acquainted with general history.
But in the opinion of an erudite Serb, to whom I showed
this passage, Mr. Taylor knows nothing of Serb and
Bulgar under the Turks. There is no single document nor
anything else that speaks of hatred between them. On
the contrary, they were always on friendly terms. The
antagonisms of the Middle Ages, as Mr. Taylor surely
knows, were the work of rulers who paid no attention to
the national will; there was at that time no national
consciousness, and just as a Serbian would wage war
with a Bulgarian prince, so would he do battle with a
Croat or with another Serbian ruler. Mr. Taylor talks
of "the almost constant state of warfare between Serbs
and Bulgars...," but he does not mention that there
were many cases during the late war in which the men
showed friendliness to one another. He may argue that
if a soldier calls out "Brother" to his foe and subsequently
slays him there is not much to be said for his friendliness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
but surely that is to draw no distinction between what
is the soldier's pleasure and his business. "Nothing,"
observes Mr. Taylor very truly, "nothing in the Balkan
Peninsula is so desirable as the laying aside of the feud."
He may take it that this feud has been aroused and maintained
among the <i>intelligentsia</i> and for political reasons,
with Macedonia in the forefront. I think he would not
be so severe on those who are "ignorant apparently
that the mutual animosity has its roots deep down in the
history and historical consciousness of Serb and Bulgar"
if he remembered that the Bulgars wanted Michael for
their prince, and if he had been present at the siege of
Adrianople, where the Serbian and Bulgarian soldiers,
in their eagerness to fraternize, took to speaking their
respective languages incorrectly, the Serb dropping his
cases and the Bulgar his article, in the hope that they
would thus make themselves more easily understood.
It seems to me not only more advisable but more rational
to ponder upon such incidents than upon the idle controversies
as to which army was the most deserving;
and I do not think it is evidence of any widespread
Bulgarian animosity because a certain official decided to
charge the Serbian Government a fee for conveying back
to Serbia the corpses of their soldiers.</p>

<p>With regard to the two languages, the differences
between them will matter no more than does the difference
between Serbo-Croatian and Slovene. The Serb-Croat-Slovene
State has been astonishingly little incommoded
by the fact that the Slovene language is quite distinct,
the two tongues being only in a moderate degree mutually
intelligible. The Slovenes have never been exposed to
the influence either of Byzantium or of the Turks, so
that their language is free from the orientalisms which
abound in the southern dialects. But it is curious to
note<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that many of the Slovene archaisms of form and
structure, such as the persistence of the "v" for "u"
and the final -l of the past participle, which have disappeared
from Serbo-Croat, have been preserved in the
dialects of Macedonia. The Bulgarian language, the
south-eastern Serbian dialects, as well as Roumanian
and Albanian, have certain grammatical peculiarities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
through being influenced by the language of the Romanized
Thraco-Illyrian peoples with whom they merged. Even
Montenegro was to some degree influenced by this process,
having lost one or two cases, such as the locative. In
Serbia one uses seven cases, the Montenegrin generally
contents himself with about five, and in some dialects
they are all discarded.... The amount of Turanian,
Petcheneg and other undesirable blood in the Bulgars
does not&mdash;let the two or three eccentric Bulgars say what
they will&mdash;prevent them being far more Yugoslav than
anything else. Professor Cviji&#263;, the famous Rector of
Belgrade University, has made personal examinations
in Bulgaria, and is of the opinion that a great part of that
people, for instance, at Trnovo in the middle of Bulgaria,
is physically and spiritually very near to the Serbs. The
Mongol influence, he thinks, is so scattered that it is very
difficult to see.</p>

<p>Unhappily, however, in the last thirty or forty years
an enormous amount of hatred has been piled up between
Serb and Bulgar; things have happened which we as
outsiders can more easily forget than those and the
orphans of those who have suffered. Atrocities have
taken place; international commissions have recorded
some of them and non-Balkan writers have produced
a library of lurid and, almost always, strictly one-sided
books about them. I suggest that these gentlemen would
have been better employed in translating the passages
wherein Homer depicts precisely the same atrocities.
Whatever may seem good to Balkan controversialists,
let us of the West rather try, for their sake and for ours,
to bring these two people together. We have good
foundations on which to build; every Bulgar will tell
you that he is full of admiration of the Serbian army,
and the Serbs will speak in a similar strain of the Bulgars.
Also the Serbs will tell you that, no matter what else
they may be able to do, they are, as compared with
the Bulgars, quite incompetent in the diffusion of propaganda;
while the Bulgars will explain to you that in
propaganda the Serbs are immensely their superiors.
(Balkan propaganda does not confine itself to using,
with violence, the sword and the pen. In its higher
flights it will, in a disputed district, bury ancient-looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
stones with suitable inscriptions. It will go beyond the
simple changes in the termination of the surnames of
those who come under its dominion; the name upon a
tombstone will be made to end, according to circumstances,
in "off" or "vitch," sometimes in the Roumanian
"esco" or the Greek "opoulos." If this is known to the
departed, one would like to learn how it affects them.
A great deal of energy has been brought to bear in the
production of official books which place on record the
repugnant details of all the crimes that have ever been
imagined by men or ghouls, which crimes, so say the
books of nation A, have been <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'commited'">committed</ins> by the incredible
monsters of nation B. At times, from motives of economy,
the same photographs have been used by both nations&mdash;an
idea which in 1920 was adopted in Hungary, where an
artist conceived a poster showing a child with uplifted
finger saying to its mother in solemn warning: "Mother,
remember me; vote for a Social Democrat." This
poster was forbidden by the censor, and, a few days
afterwards, appeared on all street corners as that of the
Christian Socialist party. People of the Balkans found
that Western Europeans were impressed by figures, so
that they issued lists of schools whose pupils were more
numerous than the total population of the villages in
which they were situated. Frequently a village would be
stated, on the sworn testimony of its most respected
inmates, to be exclusively filled with persons say of
nation A. Not for a moment would it be admitted that
the population might perhaps be mixed. And very
possibly, on going to investigate, the Western European
would discover that the village was entirely uninhabited
and had been so for many years.... We must also
have some understanding of the old Balkan humour if
we are not to resent, for example, that story which they
tell of a Bulgarian Minister who happened to be sojourning
last year in Yugoslavia at a time when a great memorial
service was being held for ninety-nine priests whom the
Bulgars had assassinated during their occupation of
Serbia in the European War. This Minister cherishes
the hope that his country and Yugoslavia will bury the
hatchet. "How unfortunate," said he, "are these
recriminations. I shall have pleasure in sending them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
ninety-nine priests, whom they can kill, and then we can
be good friends.")</p>

<p>Thus we have two points of mutual esteem. The vast
majority of people in Belgrade and Sofia are not chauvinist;
let them close their ears to the wild professors who,
in their spare time, busy themselves with writing books
and discoursing on politics, a task for which they are
imperfectly fitted. One must naturally make allowances
for these small countries which have been so sparsely
furnished hitherto with men of education that the
Government considered it must mobilize them all. Thus
the professors found themselves enlisted in the service
of the State. Unluckily&mdash;to give examples would be
painful&mdash;it too often happened that the poor professor
damaged irretrievably his reputation and held up the
State to ribald laughter. Those who belong to an old,
cultured nation are not always cognizant of the petty
atmosphere, to say nothing of the petty salaries, which
is to-day the common lot of Balkan professors. (A really
eminent man, who, for twenty years has been a professor,
not merely a teacher, at Belgrade University
receives a very much smaller salary than that which the
deputies have voted for themselves.) Occasionally these
professors must be moved by feelings similar to those
that were entertained by the Serbs of 1808, who, having
thrown off the Turkish yoke which they were resolved
never to bear again, "earnestly expressed, and more
than once," according to Count Romanzoff,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "their own
will which induced them to beg the Emperor Alexander
to admit them to the number of his subjects." A
resolute old man, a Balkan savant of my acquaintance&mdash;he
told me he was a savant&mdash;said one day that before
all else he was a patriot, meaning by this that if in the
course of his researches he came across a fact which to
his mind was injurious for the past, present or future of
his native land he would unhesitatingly sweep that fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
into oblivion, and he seemed to be amazed that I should
doubt the morality of such a procedure. Bristling with
scorn, he refused to give me a definition of the word
"patriotism," and I am sure that, if he knows his Thoreau,
he does not for a moment believe that he is amongst
those who "love the soil which makes their graves, but
have no sympathy with the spirit which may still animate
their clay. Patriotism is a maggot in their heads."
May the people of Serbia and Bulgaria rather listen to
such men as Nicholai Velimirovi&#263;, Bishop of &#381;i&#269;a,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who&mdash;to
speak only of his sermons and lectures in our language&mdash;lives
in the memory of so many in Great Britain and
the United States on account of his wonderful eloquence,
his sincerity, his profound patriotism, and the calm
heights from which he surveys the future. For those
who think with him, the Serbs, in uniting with the Croats,
have already surmounted a more serious obstacle. They
believe that for three reasons their union with the Bulgars
is a more natural one: they practise the same religion,
they use the same Cyrillic alphabet and their civilization,
springing from Byzantium, has been identical. The two
people are bound to each other by the great Serbian,
Saint Sava, who strove to join them and who died at
Trnovo in Bulgaria. Vladislav, the Serbian prince,
asked for his body; Assen begged that the Bulgars
might be allowed to keep it, but, when the Serbs insisted,
a most remarkable procession set out from Trnovo,
bearing to his homeland the remains of him whom the
Bulgars called "our Saint." ... If, then, the two
people will for a few years demand that the misguided
professors shall confine themselves to their original
functions&mdash;and, likewise, those students who sit at the
professors' feet&mdash;one may hope that in a few years the
miserable past will be buried and all the Yugoslavs
united in one State. The time has vanished when Serbia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and Bulgaria stood, as it were in a ring, face to face with
one another, paying far more attention to the disputes of
the moment than to those great unifying forces which
we have mentioned. But now Serbia is a part of Yugoslavia,
which has to deal with a greater Italy, a greater
Roumania and others. And the question as to whether
a certain town or district is to be Serbian or Bulgarian
sinks into the background.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in the Balkans&mdash;where one is nothing
if not personal&mdash;you can express yourself concerning
another gentleman with a degree of liberty that in Western
Europe would be thought unpardonable. And so, if the
Serbs and the Bulgars will in the main follow the tracks
of their far-sighted leaders, they need not quite suppress
their criticism of each other. No great animosity is
aroused by such a statement as was made to me with
regard to a dispossessed Macedonian prelate, who had
told me that he had appealed to the Archbishop of Canterbury
in the hope that he would assist him to return to
his diocese. I asked a member of another Balkan
nationality whether he knew this ancient cleric of the
extremely venerable aspect, and whether he knew what
kind of political and religious propaganda had brought
about his downfall. "I know all about that old ruffian,"
he replied. "He stole over fifty pigs and one hundred
sheep, and about twenty-five cows and 200 lb. of fat."
Anyhow, if his lordship had heard that these accusations
had been repeated in many places, he would have been
far less indignant than if they had been printed in some
unread newspaper or obscure pamphlet.</p>

<p>Now if the local writers cease from indulging their
national partisanship&mdash;and God knows they have no
lack of material&mdash;then perhaps the time will come when
foreign publicists and politicians, who keep one eye upon
the Balkans, will be able to speak well about the particular
country which they affect without speaking ill about the
neighbouring countries, concerning which, it is possible,
they know less. Of course, there are a number of real
Balkan experts in various countries, judicious writers
who will be gratefully mentioned in this book. And
there are people, such as Mr. Harold E. Goad, the vehement
pro-Italian writer, who are quite amusing. This gentleman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
said in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> (May 1922) that once
he used to hold romantic views of Balkan politics, but
now has ascertained that they are "usually plotted,
move by move, in the coffee-shops of petty capitals.
Intrigue, bribery and calumny, personal jealousy and
racial prejudice are the ordinary means with which the
game is played." How different from the rest of Europe,
where intrigue, etc., are conspicuously absent; and the
explanation seems to be that wine and beer are unlike
coffee, which it may be quite impossible to drink without
remembering the poison which so many furtive fingers
have dropped into it. And it would be rank ingratitude
if I omitted the Italian Admiral Millo, though he was
injudicious. After he had been at his post for four
months, with the resounding title of Governor of Dalmatia
and of the Dalmatian Islands and of the islands of
Curzola, he told me that he had found it most fascinating
to motor through Dalmatia's rocky hinterland, where the
natives had the dignified air of ancient Roman senators
and even greeted you in Latin. This was rather a
startling statement. "Oh yes," said the Admiral, with
his aristocratic, bearded face wearing an expression of
even keener intelligence than usual, "I can assure you,"
quoth he, "that the peasants say 'Ave.' I heard them
quite distinctly." It was perhaps inconsiderate of those
worthy Croats not to shout with greater clearness the
word "Zdravo!" ["Good luck!"] in order to prevent the
Admiral from riding off with a confused hearing of the
second syllable. A certain excellent dispatch of his&mdash;of
which more anon&mdash;makes him a writer on the Balkans.
I know not whether he addressed to his Government a
dispatch on the above discovery, thus intensifying the
Italian resolve to cling to Dalmatia. In that case his
knowledge was unfortunate, but otherwise it is surely
as delightful as, up here among the tree-clad mountains,
are the glow-worms that go darting through the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>THE TRAGEDY OF A FRONTIER</h3>

<p>Kiepert, the famous geographer, was able, as the
result of his diligent researches and explorations, to correct
many errors in former ethnological maps; but in the map
of the Balkan Peninsula, which he published in 1870, the
country between Kustendil, Trn and Vranja is represented
by a white space. And if the people who dwell
in these wild, narrow valleys had been overlooked as
thoroughly by subsequent Congresses and Frontier Commissions
they would have been most grateful. They
only asked&mdash;this well-built, stubborn race&mdash;that one
should leave them to their own devices in their homes
among the mountains where the lilac grows. They
asked that one should leave them with their ancient
superstitions, such as that of St. Petka, who inhabited
a cavern high above the present road from Trn, while St.
Therapon, so they say, lived by himself upon a neighbouring
rock. Inside the cavern now the water drips
continuously and is collected in large bowls; these are
St. Petka's tears, which are particularly beneficial, say
the natives, for afflicted eyes. But though this region
is so poor that, towards the end of the Turkish r&eacute;gime
and during the war of Bulgarian liberation and also in
the winter of 1879-80, the people were compelled, through
lack of flour, to use a sort of "white earth," <i>bela zemja</i>,
yet this land was coveted, and now the maps no longer
show an empty space but a variety of names and a
frontier line. From the nomenclature we perceive that
the region was visited of old by people who were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Slavs&mdash;such were those who gave to a mountain the name
of Ruj, to a village the name of Erul, and to a river the
name of Jerma, which has been explained as being derived
from the Lydian Hermos, the river of St. Therapon's
birthplace. The names of Latin colouring may either be
memorials of the Romanized Thracians or else may refer
to the medi&aelig;val Catholics, whether Saxon miners or
travelling merchants. But there does not seem in the
veins of the present population to be much trace of these
other settlers or wayfarers; at any rate, the Slavs do not
differ appreciably among themselves, and the drawing of
a frontier line has been a peculiar hardship.</p>

<p>One of the greatest misfortunes of the nineteenth
century was the creation of separate Serbian and Bulgarian
kingdoms, wherein there was so small an ethnological
difference between these two branches of the Yugoslavs;
and in those districts where a frontier runs one sees
especially how criminal it was to make this separation.
Balkan philologists to-day will tell you&mdash;and even those
who are in other respects the most rabid Serbs or Bulgars&mdash;that
there is really no such thing as a Serbian and a
Bulgarian language, but only groups of Yugoslav dialects.
And yet it pleased the Great Powers to prevent the union
of the two Balkan brothers. In that region with which
we are dealing the Berlin Congress attempted to draw,
with very inadequate maps, a frontier line along the
watershed; and the Commissioners who were sent to
mark out this line, observing that many of the indicated
points did not coincide with the watershed, thought it
would be preferable to trace the frontier along the saddle,
between the tributaries of the Morava on one side and
of the Struma and the river of Trn on the other. As the
region was, however, not uninhabited the farmers were
frequently cut off, as at Topli Dol and Preseka, from the
meadows and the forests which they had regarded always
as their own. Bismarck, speaking with indifference of
"the fragments of nations that inhabit the Balkan
Peninsula," could see in the national yearning of the
Yugoslavs only a yearning for lawlessness and tumult.
So he laboured at his plan of dominating Europe with the
mighty structure of the German, Austro-Hungarian and
Russian conservative empires; and if he built it over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a stream of democracy, with results that are to-day
apparent, who knows whether the statesmen of our day
are not somewhere constructing a house which to our
descendants will appear equally ridiculous? And anyhow,
as we shall see, he was far from being the only offender
at the Berlin Congress. If that particular strip of frontier
had been drawn in the most unimpeachable fashion it
would still have been iniquitous.</p>

<p>One may object that even if the people were divided
by rough-and-ready methods, that was no reason why
they should oppose each other, and indeed a number of
frontier incidents which occurred between the time of
the Congress and 1885 were not regarded, either by Serbs
or by Bulgars, as being serious obstacles to a union. But
Russia and Austria, revelling in the intrigues, continued
to pull the two States now this way and now that, and all
too frequently against each other. It can thus not be a
matter of surprise if the rather inexperienced statesmen
of those little countries fell into line with the two Great
Powers and spent a good deal of their energies in assailing
each other. So blind, alas! were these statesmen that
all the tears of St. Petka would not have cured them,
and now the two kindred people, so progressive in many
ways, are&mdash;to speak of each people as a whole&mdash;further
apart than when their shaggy forefathers came over the
Carpathians. It has been the fate of the Yugoslavs&mdash;Slovenes,
Croats, Serbs and Bulgars&mdash;to live for centuries
beside each other and be kept always, by foreign masters,
isolated from each other. At rare intervals, as we shall
see in following their history, a person has arisen who has
tried, with altruistic or with selfish motives, to make some
sort of union of the Yugoslavs. And now we will go
back to the time when Slavs first wandered westward to
the Balkans.</p>

<p class="section">ARRIVAL OF THE SOUTHERN SLAVS</p>

<p>The Slavs who in the fifth, sixth and seventh centuries
came down from the Carpathian Mountains were known,
until the ninth century, as Slovenes (Sloventzi);<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and if,
as is natural, the Serbs and Croats wish to preserve their
time-honoured names, they will perhaps agree to call
their whole country by the still more ancient name of
Slovenia, instead of the merely geographical and not
wholly popular term Yugoslavia. Considering that this
name (Slovenija) found favour in the eyes of their great
Emperor Stephen Du&#353;an, one would imagine that the
Serbs might adopt it in preference to the cumbrous "Kingdom
of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes," with its unlovely
abbreviation into three letters of the alphabet. The
Croats would be glad of this solution, and thus the Yugoslavs
would, unlike their relatives the Russians, the Poles
and the Czechs, have the satisfaction of living in a country
called Slovenia, the land of the Slavs.... But, although
this would be a happy solution, it seems much more
probable that eventually the name Yugoslavia will be
adopted. Everyone is agreed that one inclusive word,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
answering to Britain and British, is necessary. "Evo
na&#353;ih!" ["Here are our men!"] were the words used by
the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as their troops marched
past them in Paris during the Allied celebration of July
1919. The Serbian Colonel of the Heiduk Velko regiment,
which was stationed at Split in 1920, and of which
the other officers were chiefly Croats, the men Moslem
and Catholic, used in his public addresses to speak of
"Our kingdom." There are various objections to the
word Yugoslavia; in the first place, it was introduced by
the Austrians, who did not wish to call their subjects
Serbs and Croats; in the second place, the term is a literal
translation from the German and is against the laws of
the Serbo-Croatian language. Another, and more important
objection, is that the Bulgars, though Yugoslavs,
are not included in Yugoslavia; and perhaps the name
will be officially adopted when the Bulgars join the other
Southern Slavs.</p>


<p class="section">THEIR UNFORTUNATE DEMOCRATIC WAYS</p>

<p>These Southern Slavs did not display the same genius
for organization as the Germanic peoples or the Magyars
at the period of their respective migrations. In communities
of brethren (or <i>bratsva</i>, from the word <i>brat</i>, a brother)
they had not raised up a king; but as a compensation
they possessed a lofty moral code, a religion inspired by
the worship of nature and by the principle of the
immortality of the soul. Occupying themselves with
agriculture and the rearing of cattle, it was not until
they came into contact, that is to say hostile contact,
with their more organized neighbours that they were
compelled to join together under the authority of a prince,
a <i>knez</i>. The bad result of this profoundly democratic
spirit was that the Slavs, not knowing how to keep united,
fell under the yoke of other nations. From the interesting
series of documents, Latin, Arabic, Byzantine and others,
which have been collected in <i>Monimenta Sclavenica</i> by
Miroslav Premrou, notary public at Caporetto, and
published in 1919 at Ljubljana (Laibach), we can see
that the Slovenes occupied a much greater extent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
territory than do their descendants of our day&mdash;"ab
ortu Vistul&aelig; ... per immensa spatia..." (cf. <i>Jordanis
de orig. Goth.</i> c. 5)&mdash;to beyond the Tagliamento, and from
the Piave (cf. Ibrahim Ibn-Jakub<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>) to the Adriatic, the
&AElig;gean and the Black Sea.</p>

<p>One of the earliest of the above-named Slovene princes
was Samo, a Slovene by adoption, who struggled in
Pannonia against the Avars in the first half of the seventh
century; it happened also in the year 626 that other
Slovenes, as well as the Avars, attacked Constantinople.
Both of them withdrew, the former being defeated at sea
and the latter failing under the city walls. The Avars,
having thus shown that they were vulnerable, had to bear
an attack on a grand scale made upon them by the
Slovenes, this attack being more shrewdly organized
than any other transaction in which the Slovenes had as
yet engaged. And they still appeared to be reluctant
to form even a loosely knit State; they roamed about the
Balkans and the adjacent countries to the north-west,
seeking for lands that were adapted to their patriarchal
organization. Not until the ninth century did they set
up what might be called Governments on the Adriatic
littoral, where they had no hostility to fear from the last
remaining Romans, who were refugees in certain towns
and islands.</p>


<p class="section">TWO EARLY STATES</p>

<p>The two most important of these Slav States were,
firstly, that one, the predecessor of our modern Croatia,
which extended from the mouth of the Ra&#353;a (Ar&#353;a) in
Istria to the mouth of the Cetina in central Dalmatia,
and, secondly, to the south-east a principality, afterwards
called Ra&#353;ka, in what is now western Serbia. In a little
time the Slavs began to have relations with the towns
of the Dalmatian coast and with the islands which were
nominally under the sway of Byzantium, but in consequence
of their remoteness and their exposed position had
succeeded in becoming almost independent republics.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p class="section">ECCLESIASTICAL ROCKS</p>

<p>Now Christianity had been definitely introduced into
Dalmatia in the fourth century, but it was not until
several centuries later that it made any headway with the
Slavs, of whom the Croats, in the ninth century, were
baptized by Frank missionaries. The arrival of the Slavs,
by the bye, had been sometimes looked upon with scanty
favour by the Popes: in July of the year 600 we find
Gregory <small>I.</small> saying in a letter to the Bishop of Salona that
he was much disturbed at the news he had just received
"de Sclavorum gente, qu&aelig; vobis valde imminet, affligor
vehementer et conturbor." Similarly, the Council of
Split branded the Slav missionaries as heretics and the
Slav alphabet as the invention of the devil.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> ... While
the Croats were falling<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> under the dominion of the Franks,
the holy brothers St. Cyril and St. Methodus, who had
been born at Salonica in 863, were carrying the first Slav
book from Constantinople to Moravia, whither they
travelled at the invitation of the Prince of Moravia,
Rastislav, St. Cyril going as an apostle and theologian,
St. Methodus as a statesman and organizer. This famous
book was a translation from the Greek, but it was written
in Pal&aelig;o-Slav characters, the Glagolitic that were to
become so venerated that when the French kings were
crowned at Reims their oath was sworn upon a Glagolitic
copy of the Gospels;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and the spirit of that earliest book
was also Slav: it expresses the political and cultural
resistance of Prince Rastislav against the State of the
Franks, that is, against the German nationality, of whom
it was feared that with the Cross in front of them they
would trample down for ever the political liberties of
the young Slav peoples. German theologians were
giving a more and more dogmatic character to Western
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>Christianity, whereas the Christianity of the East was
at that time more liberal; it gathered to itself the
Slavs of Ra&#353;ka and of the neighbouring regions, such as
southern Dalmatia, while the influence which it exerted
was so powerful that when the Croats, after vacillating
between the two Churches, finally joined that of Rome,
they took with them the old Slav liturgy that is used by
them in many places on the mainland and the islands
down to this day. Thus their Church became a national
institution, and that in spite of all the long-continued
efforts of the Vatican, as also of the Venetian Republic.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy, by the way, is endeavouring
to have this liturgy made lawful in the whole of Yugoslavia;
the only opponent I met was a Jesuit at Zagreb
who foresaw that the priests, being no longer obliged to
learn Latin, might indeed omit to do so. Pope Pius <small>X.</small> was
likewise an opponent of the Slav liturgy, because a Polish
priest told him that it would lead to Pan-Slavism and
hence to schism; but it is thought&mdash;among others by
the patriotic Prince-Bishop Jegli&#263; of Ljubljana&mdash;that the
late Pope would have given his consent, had it not been
for Austria, which recoiled from what would have probably
strengthened the Slav element. One of the cherished
policies of Austria was to utilize in every possible way the
religious differences between the Southern Slavs.</p>


<p class="section">THE SLAVS AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS</p>

<p>But the two States formed beside the Adriatic and
in Ra&#353;ka were not only separated from early days by their
religion; they had quite different neighbours to deal
with. In 887 the Croats imposed their will on the Venetians,
against whom they had been for some time waging
war&mdash;and not merely a defensive war&mdash;the Venetians
having attacked the country in order to despoil it of timber
and of people, whom they liked to sell in the markets
of the Levant. In 887, however, after the defeat and
death of their doge, Pietro Candiano, the Venetians were
forced to pay&mdash;and paid without interruption down to the
year 1000&mdash;an annual tribute to the Croats, who in return
permitted them to sail freely on the Adriatic. Beside
that sea the Croats founded new towns, such as &#352;ibenik<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
(of which the Italian name is Sebenico), and carried on an
amicable intercourse with the autonomous Byzantine
towns: Iader, the picturesque modern capital which
they came to call Zadar and the Venetians Zara;
Tragurium, the delightful spot which is their Trogir and
the Venetian Tra&ugrave;, and so forth. These friendly relations
existed both before 882 and subsequently, when the towns
agreed to pay the Croats an annual tribute, in return for
which the local provosts were confirmed in office by the
rulers of Croatia. We have plentiful evidence from the
ruins of royal castles and of the many churches built by
the Slavs in this period, as well as from the discoveries of
arms and ornaments, that the people had attained to a
condition of prosperity. At the beginning of the tenth
century, so we are told by the learned emperor and
historian Constantine Porphyrogenetos, the Croatian
Prince Tomislav could raise 100,000 infantry and 60,000
cavalry; he had likewise eighty large vessels, each with a
crew of forty men, at his disposal, and a hundred smaller
ships with ten to twenty men in each of them.</p>

<p>As for the State of Ra&#353;ka, protected on the south and
west by formidable mountains, and in the very centre
of the Serbian tribes, it is there that the lore and customs
of the people have survived in their purest form. Ra&#353;ka
was the land in which the love of liberty was always kept
alive and from there the expeditions used to sally forth
whose aim, frustrated many times, it was to found
a powerful Serbian State. The chieftain, Tshaslav
Kronimirovi&#263;, did, as a matter of fact, succeed in uniting
his State with two others, one being in Bosnia and the
other in Zeta, which is now Montenegrin. He even added
three other provinces on the Adriatic coast; but after
his death the State was dissolved and in the course of the
conflicts which followed, the State of Zeta assumed the
leadership. It had been necessary for these Serbian
rulers of Ra&#353;ka and Zeta to resist the frequent assaults
not only of the Byzantines but of the Bulgars.</p>


<p class="section">SIMEON THE BULGAR</p>

<p>"Frequent assaults" is probably a correct description
of what the Serb of that period had to endure at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
hands of this particular opponent, the Bulgar. Having
swarmed across the Peninsula, the Bulgar was now in the
act of consolidating a great kingdom, for this was the
magnificent epoch of the Bulgarian Tzar Simeon, whose
word ran far and wide from the Adriatic. The Bulgarian
map<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which exhibits the Tzardom at the death of Simeon
is painted in the same brown colour from opposite Corfu
right across to the Black Sea and up as far as the mouths
of the Danube, which signifies that in those parts (including,
of course, Macedonia) the word of Simeon was supreme.
But the Serbian provinces of Ra&#353;ka, Zeta, Bosnia and
some adjoining lands are painted brown and white, being
hatched with white diagonal lines; and this indicates very
candidly that in the north-west Simeon was not omnipotent.
We are indeed told in the letterpress that "on
the other hand Simeon meanwhile took the opportunity
to settle accounts with the Serbians because of their
perfidious policy, and he subjected them in the year 924";
but doubtless this was a kind of subjection which in 925
would have to be repeated, and this would account for
one of Simeon's faithful chroniclers having made that
allusion to perfidious policy. Of the Tzar himself we
are given an attractive picture: unlike his father, Boris,
who patronized Slav literature for the reason that it
made his State less permeable to Byzantine influence,
Simeon had no political object in his encouragement of
native literature.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He was himself a man of letters,
having studied at Constantinople. He was acquainted
with Aristotle and Demosthenes, he discussed theology
with the most eminent doctors of the Church, and of
positive science&mdash;or of what was then regarded as such&mdash;he
possessed everything which had survived the great
shipwreck of ancient thought. Not only did he found
monasteries and schools, but he gathered writers round
him; and, in order to stimulate them, he himself wrote
original books and translations, thus ennobling, we are
told, the literary vocation in the eyes of his rude and
warlike race. He would probably have smiled if he had
known that one of his writers had attributed to him the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>subjection of the Serbs; but what one would like to
learn is whether Macedonia, even then a kaleidoscope
of races, was more or less completely under the shadow
and the brilliance of his sword, more or less completely
subjugated. Four centuries later the Serbs were to have
a Macedonian empire which, like Simeon's, dissolved on
the death of its founder. To these old empires the Serb
and the Bulgar of our day are looking back, and it would
be interesting to know if harassed Macedonia was calmly
content to be first Bulgarian and then Serbian, or whether
it was a calm of that Eastern kind which means that a
ruler's assaults upon the people are infrequent.</p>


<p class="section">WHAT ARE THE BULGARS?</p>

<p>And now, as the matter is in dispute, it is necessary
to examine the origin of the Bulgarian people. A band
of Turanian or Bulgarian warriors, probably not over
10,000 in number and led by one Asperouch or Isperich,
had crossed the Danube in the year 679, had subdued the
Slav tribes in those parts&mdash;for the newcomers reaped the
advantage of being a well-disciplined people&mdash;and by the
end of the eighth century had settled down in their tents
of felt along the banks of the Danube. Then, after
another hundred years, in the district bounded by Varna,
Rustchuk and the Balkans, one may say that the original
Turanians, a branch of the Huns, had been absorbed by
the Slavs. "The forefathers of the Bulgars," says the
great Slavist, Dr. Constantine Jire&#269;ek of Prague, in his
<i>History of the Bulgars</i>, "are not the handful of Bulgars who
conquered in 679 a part of M&oelig;sia along the Danube, but
the Slavs who much earlier had settled in M&oelig;sia, as well
as in Thrace, Macedonia, Epirus and almost the whole
Peninsula." With regard to the retention of the name
there is an analogy in France, where the Gauls came under
the subjection of German Franks, who ultimately disappeared,
but left their name to the country. So, too,
the Greeks in Turkey who call themselves Romei, the
name of their former rulers, and their language Romeica,
though they are not Romans and do not speak Latin.
To such an extent have the original Bulgars been absorbed
by the Yugoslavs that even the most ancient known form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of the Bulgarian language, dating from the ninth century,
retains hardly any relics of the original Bulgarian tongue;
and this tongue has in our time, with the exception of a
word or two, been entirely lost: there is a celebrated old
MS. in Moscow<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which orientalists and historians have
pondered over and which has now been explained by the
Finnish professor Mikola and the Bulgarian professor
Zlatarski to be a chronology of Bulgarian pagan princes,
of whom the first are rather fabulous. Here and there,
amid the old Slav, are strange words which are supposed
to signify Turanian chronology, cycles of lunar years.
And in a village between &#352;umen and Prjeslav there was
found an inscription of the Bulgarian prince Omortag
(?802-830), where in the Greek language, for the Bulgars
had at that period no writing of their own, he says that
he built something; and amid the Greek there is the word
<ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: Transliterated as 'sigor-alem'">&#963;&#953;&#947;&#959;&#961;-&#945;&#955;&#949;&#956;</ins>, which occurs also in the above-mentioned
document and is regarded as Turanian.... What we do
know about this race is by no means so discreditable;
it is true that they are reputed to have had no great
esteem for the aged, and, according to a Chinese chronicle
of the year 545, "the characters of their writing are like
those of the barbarians." They held it to be glorious
to die in battle, shameful to die of sickness. For the
violation of a married woman, as well as for the hatching
of plots and rebellion, the penalty was death, and if you
seduced a girl you were compelled to pay a fine and also
to marry her. Their sense of discipline, which served
them so well in their contact with other people, was
remarkably applied to their social life; thus a stepson was
under an obligation to marry his father's widow, a nephew
the widow of his uncle, and a younger brother the widow
of an elder. It may be that the two much-quoted
writers who claim that the modern Bulgars are of this
race were moved more by their admiration of such customs
than by scientific scrutiny. One of them, Christoff, who
assumed the name of Tartaro-Bulgar to show that he
believed in his theories, is usually thought nowadays to
have been more of a poet than a devotee of erudition;
if he had been still more of a poet, approaching, say,
Pencho Slaveikoff, we would take less objection to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
waywardness. The other champion of that ancestry is
Theodore Paneff, who showed himself a brilliant and
courageous officer during the war of 1912-1913. The
fact that he was himself of Armenian origin&mdash;he changed
his name&mdash;would, of course, not invalidate his Bulgarian
studies; but even as he spoke Bulgarian with a Russian
accent, so is he looked upon as writing like certain
Russians; and his other literary work, such as that on
the psychology of crowds, is held to be of more value.
At all events in 1916 when a number of Bulgarian deputies
made a joyous progress to the capitals of their allies,
under the leadership of the Vice-President of the
Sobranje, Dr. Momchiloff, renowned at the time as a
Germanophil, they were welcomed with great pomp
at Buda-Pest and declared in ceremonial orations to
be brothers of the Turanian Magyars; but Momchiloff
deprecated this idea. "We are brothers," he said, "of
the Russians, and see what we have done to them!"
It was also during the War that Dr. Georgov, Professor
of Philosophy and Rector of Sofia University, wrote a
dissertation in a Buda-Pest newspaper,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> which demonstrated
very clearly to the Hungarians that the Bulgars
are Slavs; the Professor points out that the Turanians
had so rapidly been absorbed that Prince Omortag
bestowed Slav names upon his sons, and this complete
mingling of the radically different peoples was assisted,
says the Professor, by the fact that those Bulgarian hordes
in the days before they crossed the Danube were already
partly mixed with Slavs, since they had been wandering
for decades to the north of the Danube, around Bessarabia,
in which country the Slavs were members of the same
Slovene race as those whom they were afterwards to
meet. So thoroughly were the original Bulgars submerged
in the Slavs that when their sons set out from
the district between Varna, Rustchuk and the Balkans,
proceeding west and south, they met with no resistance
from the unorganized Slavs of M&oelig;sia and Thrace, owing
to the circumstance that these latter did not feel that the
new arrivals were strangers. In fact, says the Professor,
there are in the present Bulgarian people far fewer and
far fainter traces of the original Bulgars than there are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>of the old Thracians, as also of the Greeks and of the
different people who in the course of the great migrations
probably left here and there some stragglers. Sir Charles
Eliot says of the Bulgars that "though not originally
Slavs they have been completely Slavized, and all the
ties arising from language, religion and politics connect
them with the Slavs and not with Turkey or even Hungary."
Professor Cviji&#263;, by the way, who in 1920 received
the Patron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society
for his researches into Balkan ethnology, regards the
author of <i>Turkey in Europe</i> as a greater authority in
this field than himself.... It is not easy, away from
Montenegro and a few remote valleys, to find communities
on the Balkan mainland that are altogether free from
alien blood; Turks have come and gone, Crusaders of all
nationalities have passed this way, with their hangers-on,
here was the road from Europe to Asia, and here amid
the ruin of empires lay much that was worth gathering.
No doubt the Serbs, whose land was not so much a
thoroughfare, have in their veins some Illyrian and other,
but on the whole much less non-Slav blood than the
Bulgars; still, when we consider some subsequent invasions
of Bulgaria, we must ascertain how far they
spread. For example, the Kumani who arrived in the
thirteenth century were, according to Leon Cahun,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Turks of the Kiptchak nation, speaking a pure Turkish
dialect; they&mdash;that is to say, the Gagaous who are supposed
to be their descendants&mdash;are now Christians, they
speak modern Turkish and inhabit the shores of the Black
Sea and the region of Adrianople; they have kept much
to themselves and are recognizable by their dark faces,
large teeth and hirsute appearance. There are people
who assert that all Bulgars have a physical divergence
from other Yugoslavs, but, except if they happened to
come across one of these Gagaous or some such person,
it appears more likely that they saw what they went
out to see. Naturally, if not very logically, those who
regard the Bulgars in a hostile fashion have often
brandished the arguments of Messrs. Tartaro-Bulgar
and Paneff; if they will be so good as to accept what I
honestly believe is the truth with regard to this people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
they may have the pleasure of denouncing the Bulgar
even more, seeing that his Yugoslav blood gives him less
excuse for being what he has been. We shall have
occasion, later on, to discuss his primitive as well as
his more refined vices, endeavouring to ascertain how
far they are not shared by his neighbours and whether
he has any virtues peculiar to himself.</p>


<p class="section">STEPHEN NEMANIA</p>

<p>After this long excursion into troubled waters we will
go back to the Serbian States of Ra&#353;ka and Zeta. In the
year 1168 the former of these was under the rule of
Stephen Nemania (1168-1196), who bore the title of
"Grand &#381;upan," which means chief of a province. He
was on friendly terms with the "Ban," or governor, of
Bosnia, and with his assistance he added Zeta to his
possessions. It was in his beneficial reign that the
Bogomile heresy was propagated in Serbia&mdash;later on to
spread through Bosnia and thence, under the name of
Albigensian heresy, to France. Nemania summoned an
assembly to decide on a plan of action; they resolved
that this heresy should be exterminated by force of arms,
seeing that most of the population belonged to the
Orthodox religion. But Nemania was tolerant towards
the Catholic Church, which had a considerable following
in the Serbian provinces of the Adriatic coast, and this
attitude became him well, for although he was the son of
Orthodox parents he was born in a western part of the
country where there was no Orthodox priest, so that he
was baptized according to the Catholic rite and only
joined the Orthodox Church at a considerably later date.
A suggestive incident occurred in the year 1189, when
Frederick Barbarossa, on his way to Constantinople and
Jerusalem, was met at Ni&#353; by the Grand &#381;upan, who
presented him with corn, wine, oxen and various other
commodities, placed the Serbs under his protection, and
concluded with him and with the Bulgars a military
convention for the taking of Constantinople. When at
last Nemania was tired of fighting and administration
he withdrew to the splendid monastery of Studenica,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
which he had built, and afterwards to the promontory
of Mt. Athos, where his younger son, who called himself
Sava and was to become the great St. Sava, had from his
seventeenth year embraced the monastic life.</p>


<p class="section">THE SLOVENES ARE SUBMERGED</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Slavs of Croatia and those farther to
the north and west, with whom was kept alive the old
name of Slovene, had been at grips with various neighbours.
It has been said of the Slovenes that, shepherds
and peasants for the most part, they have practically
no national history, seeing that when the realm of Samo,
who was himself a Frank, came to an end, they were subjected
to the Lombards, to the Bavarians and finally to
Charlemagne and his successors. Unlike the Serbs and
the Croats, they had no warlike aristocracy; in fact,
the only two Slovene magnates who displayed any
national zeal were two Counts of Celje (Cilli) of whom the
first rose to be Ban of Croatia and the second, Count
Ulrich, the last of his race, was in 1486 assassinated by
Hungarians in Belgrade, thus causing his domains to
fall to the Habsburgs.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But if the little, scattered Slovene
people had to bend before the storm, if they withdrew
from their outposts in the two Austrias, in northern
Styria, in Tirol, in the plains of Frioul and in Venetia,
they settled down, thirteen centuries ago, in a region
which they still inhabit. This is bounded to the north
approximately by the line extending from Villach&mdash;Celovec
(Klagenfurt)&mdash;Spielfeld&mdash;Radgona (Radkersburg)&mdash;and
the mouth of the river Mur, although there are
noteworthy fragments at each end: about 65,000 on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
hills to the west of the Isonzo (of whom 40,000 have
been since 1866 under Italy), and about 120,000, partly
Catholics and partly Protestants, who live on the other
bank of the Mur. Anyone who wished to follow the
fortunes of the Slovenes through the Middle Ages would
have chiefly to consult the chronicles of the Holy Roman
Empire; he would find them in their old home at Gorica,
but with a German Count placed over them, he would
find them being gradually supplanted by the Germans
in such towns as Maribor (Marburg) and Radgona, being
thrust out to the villages and the countryside; nowhere
except in the province of Carniola would he find a homogeneous
Slovene population. It is an interesting fact<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
that in the fifteenth century theirs was the "domestic
language" of the Habsburgs, even as in our time the
Suabian-Viennese; but until the era of Napoleon they
took practically no part in the world's affairs, and the
part which they were wont to take was to fight other
people's battles: for example, when the Venetians,
in the midst of all their hectic merriment, were making
the last stand, it was largely to the Schiavoni, that is
Slovene, regiments that they entrusted their defence.
We are told that there was no question of the loyalty
and the fighting qualities of the Schiavoni and of their
sturdy fellow-Slavs, the Morlaks of Dalmatia. It was
not possible for the authorities to provide ships enough
to bring over sufficient resources to maintain all those
who were eager to fight.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In spite of all the centuries
of political suppression the little Slovene people, which
to-day only numbers 1,300,000, retained its identity
with even more success than a certain frog in Ljubljana,
their capital; for that wonderful creature, though preserving
its shape in the middle of a black-and-white marble
table at the Museum, has allowed itself to become black-and-white
marble. We shall see how Napoleon awoke
the Slovenes, how Metternich put them to sleep again,
how they roused themselves in 1848 and what a r&ocirc;le
they have played in the most recent history.</p>

<p class="section">THE FATE OF THE CROATS</p>

<p>The Croats were to be much more prominent in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Middle Ages. They did not, it is true, always manage
to hold their heads above water; but they can now look
back with more gratification than regret on the interminable
conflicts which they had to sustain against the
Hungarians on the one hand, the Venetians on the other.
The Hungarian monarch, anxious to have an outlet on
the Adriatic, attempted to cajole the Croats into electing
him as their king, on the score of his being the brother
of the wife of a late Croatian ruler. He secured by force
what his pleadings had not gained him, and subsequently
the link between Croatia and Hungary was more than
once broken and reunited within the space of a few
years; at last it was arranged that there was to be a
purely personal union under the vigorous King Kolomon,
and so it continued, with varying interference on the
part of the Hungarians, until the dynasty of Arpad
became extinct in 1301. The functionary who represented
the central power in Croatia&mdash;there being for part of
this period a similar official for Slavonia, the adjoining
province&mdash;had the title of Ban. He was at the head of
the Croatian army, he pronounced sentences in the name
of the king and had other functions, so that the office
came to be regarded with profound respect by the Croats,
and many of its holders tried to deserve this sentiment....
Among the duties assumed by King Kolomon was that
of recovering from the Venetians those coastal towns
and islands which had fallen to them, owing to the chaos
in Croatia. For more than two hundred years&mdash;that is,
until the middle of the fourteenth century&mdash;this warfare
between the Hungaro-Croatian kings and Venice raged
without interruption; apparently the Dalmatian towns
and islands were most unwilling to come under the sway
of Venice. We read everywhere of how they themselves
put up a strenuous resistance. At Zadar, the capital,
where Pope Alexander <small>III.</small> had in the year 1177 been
welcomed by the people with rejoicings and Croatian
songs, a chain was drawn across the harbour in 1202,
for the people hoped in this way to keep out the Venetians,
who, with a number of Frenchmen, were starting out on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the famous Fourth Crusade&mdash;that enterprise which ended,
on the outward journey, underneath the walls of Constantinople.
The Venetians forced their way into Zadar,
plundered and devastated it; and in order to mollify
the Pope, who was indignant at Crusaders having behaved
in this fashion against a Christian town, they subscribed
towards the building of the cathedral, but retained possession
of the place&mdash;this time for over a hundred and
fifty years. Yet the holding of Zadar did not imply
that of other Dalmatian towns: during this period when
Venice clung to the chief place there were a good many
changes in the not-distant town of &#352;ibenik, which was
now under the Hungarians, now under Paul Subi&#269;,
Prince of Bribir, now under the Ban Mladen <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, now
an autonomous town under Venice.</p>


<p class="section">A GALLANT REPUBLIC</p>

<p>The most renowned, as it is the most beautiful, of
Dalmatian towns, Dubrovnik (Ragusa), was always more
preoccupied with commerce and letters than with warfare.
It managed to maintain itself in glory for a very long
time, thanks to the astuteness of the citizens, who were
ever willing to give handsome tribute to a potential foe.
On occasion the Ragusans could be nobly firm, refusing
to deliver a political refugee to the Turks, and so forth.
In such tempestuous times the little State was forced to
trim its sails; there was the gibe that they were prepared
to pay lip service to anyone, and that the letters S.B. on
the flag (for Sanctus Blasius, their patron saint) indicated
the seven flags, <i>sette bandiere</i>, which they were ready to
fly. But the Republic of Dubrovnik&mdash;a truly oligarchic
republic, until the great earthquake of 1667 made it
necessary to raise a few other families into the governing
class&mdash;the republic can say, with truth, that when darkness
was over the other Yugoslavs it kept a lamp alight.
As yet the Serbian State was rising in prosperity and
Dubrovnik made a treaty of commerce with Stephen
(1196-1224), who had succeeded his father Nemania.
During this reign St. Sava, the king's brother, came
back to Serbia and organized the national Church, founding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
also numerous monasteries and churches, as well as
schools. Of the successors of Stephen we may mention
Uro&#353;, whose widow, a French princess, Helen of Anjou,
is venerated in Serbia for her good deeds and has been
canonized. King Milutine (1281-1321) made Serbia the
most united and the leading State in Eastern Europe;
under Du&#353;an, who has been called the Serbian Charlemagne,
success followed success, and under his sceptre
he gathered most of the Serbian people, as well as many
Greeks and Albanians. He had the idea&mdash;and it was not
beyond his strength&mdash;to group together all the Serbian
provinces.</p>


<p class="section">THE GLORIOUS DU&#352;AN</p>

<p>It is facile for people of the twentieth century, and
particularly so for non-Slavs, to say that this Serbian
Empire of Du&#353;an, Lord of the Serbs and Bulgars and
Greeks, whom the Venetian Senate addressed as "Gr&aelig;corum
Imperator semper Augustus," resembled the earlier Bulgarian
Empire of Simeon, who called himself Emperor
of the Bulgars and the Vlachs, Despot of the Greeks, in
that we would consider neither of them to be an empire;
and that therefore, in celebrating their glories, with
pointed reference to their Macedonian glories, the Serbs
and the Bulgars are living in a fool's paradise. No
doubt a great many persons dwelt in this Macedonia of
Simeon and Du&#353;an without being aware of the fact, for
those who called themselves Bulgars or Serbs appear to
have been chiefly the warriors, the nobles and the priests;
a large part of the people were&mdash;as they are to-day&mdash;indifferent
to such niceties. But there is latent in the
Slav mind a longing for the absolute, which, except it
be in some way corrected, inclines towards a moral
anarchy, a social nihilism and indifference as to the
destinies of the State. Looking merely at the consequence,
it does not greatly seem to matter how
this attitude is brought about.... One must admit
that these two realms occupied in their world most
prominent positions&mdash;positions to which they would not
have attained if Simeon and Du&#353;an had not been altogether
exceptional men, for on their death there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
not anybody great enough to keep the great men of the
State together. We have spoken of Simeon's peaceful
labours&mdash;we might cultivate more than we do the literature
of that age if it were less dedicated to religious
topics, which anyhow at that time gave little scope for
originality&mdash;his consummate ability as a soldier and
statesman is revealed in the existence of his empire; we
find in the Code of Du&#353;an, before such a thing flourished
in England, the institution of trial by jury, while Hermann
Wendel<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> has pointed out that the peasants were protected
from rapacious landowners much more effectively
than in the Germany of that age.... We need not try
to establish whether the simple Macedonian desired to
be under Simeon or Du&#353;an; but even if these two
monarchs had, each of them, as far as was then possible,
complete control of the country, one would scarcely urge
that after all these centuries this is any reason why
Macedonia should fall to Bulgaria or to Serbia. We shall
have to see whether by subsequent merits or activities
either of them has acquired the right to absorb these
outlying Slavs who, be it noted, if in our day they are
questioned as to their nationality, will often reply&mdash;and
even to an enthusiastic, armed person from one of the
interested States&mdash;the worried Macedonian Slavs, of whom
a quarter or maybe a third do really not know what they
are, will reply that they are members of the Orthodox
Church.</p>

<p>Du&#353;an perceived that an alliance with Venice would
serve his ends; he did not cease trying to persuade the
Venetians that such an arrangement was also in their
interest. After having sent an army to Croatia, in the
hope of liberating that people from the Hungarians, he
conquered Albania, and in 1340 asked to be admitted
as a citizen of the Most Serene Republic. In 1345 he
informed the Senate that it was his intention to be
crowned in <i>imperio Constantinopolitaneo</i>, and at the same
time suggested an alliance <i>pro acquisitione imperii Constantinopolitani</i>.
But Venice, while reiterating her protestations
of friendship, declined his offers; for she could
not bring herself to join her fortunes to those of an ally
who might become a rival.</p>

<p class="section">EVIL DAYS AND THE PEOPLE'S HERO</p>

<p>On the death of Du&#353;an his dominions fell apart, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that the conquering Turk, who now appeared, was only
met with isolated resistance. At a battle on the river
Maritza in 1371 the Christians were utterly routed and,
among other chieftains, King Vuka&#353;in was slain. His
territories had included Prizren in the north, Skoplje,
where Du&#353;an had been crowned, Ochrida and Prilep.
It was Prilep, amid the bare mountains, which passed
into the hands of Marko, the king's son, Marko Kraljevi&#263;,
and thereabouts are the remains of his churches and
monasteries. But for the Serbs and the Bulgars Marko
is associated with deeds of valour; he has become the
protagonist of a grand cycle of heroic songs, wherein his
wondrous exploits are recalled. Although he was, by
force of circumstances, a Turkish vassal, and, fighting
under them, he perished in Roumania in 1394, so that
historically he may not have played a very helpful part,
yet it is to him that numerous victories over the Turk
are ascribed. He is said to have been engaged in combat
against the three-headed Arab, to have waged solitary
and triumphant warfare against battalions of Turks, to
have passed swiftly on his faithful charger &#352;arac from
one end of the country to another, to have defended the
Cross against the Crescent, to have succoured the poor
and the weak, to have conversed with the long-haired
fairies, the "samovilas," of the forest lakes, who gave
him their protection, and he is said to have assisted
girls to marry by abolishing the Turkish restrictions.
They say that he is still alive, and when he reappears,
gloriously seated on &#352;arac, then will the people be free,
at last, and united.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Through the long centuries of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Turkish oppression he&mdash;who personifies many of the
traits in the national character, with Christian and with
pagan attributes&mdash;he, in these legends, many of which
have a high poetic value, was able to keep alive the hope
of deliverance. From one end of the Balkans to the
other, from Varna to Triest, the popular hero is Marko
Kraljevi&#263;. He is as much the personage of Bulgarian
as of Serbian folk-songs, and this is well, seeing that he
was a Serbian prince while many of his adoring subjects
were Bulgars&mdash;the noble Albanian chronicler, Musachi,
for instance, calls his father Re di Bulgaria. As Marko
is dear to them in song the Bulgars have come to
think that he was a Bulgar; thereupon the Serbs point
out that he was the son of Vuka&#353;in, that Marko is an
admittedly Serbian name, and that Kralj (King) and
Kraljevi&#263; are titles so unknown in Bulgaria that when the
Sofia newspapers alluded to Louis Philippe, Ferdinand's
grandfather, they spoke of him&mdash;him of all people&mdash;as
Tzar Louis Philippe. Thereupon the Bulgars retort that,
anyhow, Marko was cruel and perfidious and a braggart
and a drunkard and a fighter against Christians, and a
fighter remarkable for cowardice. But if we are going
to look at the private character of all the world's national
heroes, we shall be the losers more than they. Let
Marko, who joins the Serb and the Bulgar in song, find
them engaged, when he comes back, in drinking together
and not in making him the subject of antiquarian and
acrimonious debate.</p>


<p class="section">THE "GOOD CHRISTIANS" OF BOSNIA</p>

<p>While Serbia was listening to the Turkish cavalry,
the Ban of Bosnia, Tvertko, raised that province to its
greatest eminence. Being a collateral heir of the old
house of Nemania, and having wide Serbian lands under
his rule, he had himself proclaimed king on the tomb of
St. Sava in 1377. He called his banat "the kingdom of
Serbia," and allied himself to Prince Lazar, the most
powerful of the Serbian rulers who were still independent.
In Bosnia at this time the Bogomile heresy, after winning
the people of Herzegovina, that wild and mournful
province, attracted not only the peasants but the bans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Just as Du&#353;an and other Balkan princes had made of an
autocephalous Church the surest foundation of their
States, so did the Bans of Bosnia, beginning with Kulin
at the close of the twelfth century, see in the Bogomile
movement a national Church that would render their
subjects more intractable to outside influences, to religious
suggestions emanating from Rome, and to political
ambitions that came from Hungary. The people, for
their part, flocked to the ranks of the "good Christians,"
as the sect was called, on account of the Bogomile humility,
the democratic organization of a Church that was in such
contrast with the formalism of Byzantine ceremonial,
and also on account of some pagan superstitions that
were mingled with this Christianity and made to these
simple, recently converted Christians a most potent
appeal. It was in vain that the Popes preached a
crusade against the Bogomiles, in vain that the Kings of
Hungary descended on their heretical vassals; for the
ban, in one way or another, would divert that wrath&mdash;sometimes,
if no other choice presented itself, he became
the temporary instrument of this wrath while standing
at the people's back. From all the world, so say contemporary
records, there was a constant stream of heretics
to Bosnia, where now the Bogomiles were found in the
most exalted positions. Ceaselessly the Popes persecuted
them, and when at last in Sigismund of Hungary
an ardent extirpator visited the land there came about a
terrible result, which has made Bosnia so different from
other Serbian territories.</p>


<p class="section">KOSSOVO</p>

<p>Tvertko did his utmost to make of Bosnia the kernel
of another great Slav State. The death of Lewis of
Hungary freed him from his most redoubtable adversary;
Dalmatia, Croatia and other lands were joining him&mdash;but
then in 1389 came Kossovo, the fatal field of blackbirds,
where a disloyal coalition of Serbian, Croatian,
Albanian and Bulgarian chieftains went down in irretrievable
disaster. Milos Obili&#263;, who is now one of
Serbia's popular heroes, had been suspected of lukewarmness;
he answered his accusers by gaining access to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Sultan's camp and slaying the Sultan. Not only did
the Turks put him to death, but they decapitated their
prisoner, Prince Lazar, and all the other chiefs.</p>

<p>The Slavs along the Adriatic were now also on the
eve of dire misfortune: protracted wars of succession,
in consequence of the death in 1382 of Lewis of Hungary,
had ravaged that country and Croatia, so that
in their enfeebled condition they could give no assistance
to the towns and islands of Dalmatia which for so long
had been struggling to elude the grip of Venice. But
even so&mdash;and with many places handing themselves over
voluntarily, in disgust at the almost incredible treason
of their elected monarch, Ladislas of Naples, who, after
long bargaining, sold his rights to Venice for a hundred
thousand ducats, and with many places, in dread of the
Turks, placing themselves under the protection of Venice&mdash;even
so the Venetians had a great deal of trouble in
occupying Dalmatia, and a hundred years elapsed before
they had the whole of it. As for the two ports, Triest
and Rieka (Fiume), they had passed through various
episcopal or aristocratic hands. Triest had been in a
position to set her face against falling to Venice, of whom
she had had, from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, an
adequate experience. Both Triest and Rieka were now
to pass into the power of the Habsburgs.</p>


<p class="section">GATHERING DARKNESS</p>

<p>For a few years after Kossovo the Serbs resisted;
but their efforts, now at Belgrade, which was made the
capital and fortified by Stephen the chivalrous son of
Prince Lazar, now at Smederevo on the Danube, were
spasmodic. Bands of Turks and also of Magyars were
terrorizing the country; and the sagacious old despot
George Brankovi&#263; was the last to offer opposition to the
Turk at Smederevo. Meanwhile in Bosnia, the Bogomiles,
driven to despair by persecution, had been calling
to the Turk. Constantinople fell in 1453, Serbia laid
down her arms in 1459, while in 1463 Muhammed <span class="smcap">ii.</span>
appeared before Jajce, Bosnia's capital, where one can
still see the skeleton of Stephen Toma&#382;evi&#263;, the last
king, who was executed by the Sultan's order. And now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in this land of heresy, which had become so hostile to
the established Churches, hundreds of those who professed
the Bogomile faith went over eagerly to Islam;
they hoped that in this way they would triumph at the
expense of their late persecutors. Those who had worldly
possessions were the first to embrace Islam, in order to
safeguard them. Those who had neither wealth nor
much accumulated hatred remained Christians. One
would expect that people who had adopted a religion
under these impulses would be even more uncompromising
than the usual convert, and indeed, as a general rule,
the ex-Christian begs and aghas displayed until recent
times not only a more than Turkish observance of
the outward forms of Islam but a tyranny over the
wretched raias, their slaves, that was much more than
Turkish.</p>

<p>Fortune had turned her back upon the Southern
Slavs. In the north the Slovenes were imprisoned in the
Holy Roman Empire, while the Croats&mdash;save for the time
when they were under Tvertko&mdash;had a succession of alien
rulers, such as the aforementioned Ladislas, whom they
naturally disliked.</p>

<p>After Kossovo some of the Serbian nobles had fled
to Hungary, to Bosnia and to Montenegro. It was among
the almost inaccessible, bleak rocks of Montenegro that
a few thousand Serbs managed to retain their liberty.
Various Serbian tribes or clans thus found a refuge, and
owing to their isolation from each other they preserved
their differences. They have, in fact, preserved them, as
well as the tribal organization, down to the present day.
And then there was Dubrovnik, the stalwart little
republic. Now that she stood alone she needed all her
acumen. Yet if she paid necessary tribute to the powerful,
she would not give up helping the fallen. From this
Catholic town in 1390, the following message was sent
to the Serbian Prince Vuk Brankovi&#263;: "If&mdash;and God
forbid that it should be so&mdash;Gospodin Vuk should not
succeed in saving Serbia, and should be driven thence
either by the Magyars or the Turks or anyone else, we
will receive the Gospodin Vuk and the Gospodja Mara
his wife, together with their children and their treasure,
in all good faith in our city; and if Gospodin Vuk desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to build a church of his own faith here for his use, he shall
be at liberty to do so."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Darkness lay over the world of the Southern Slav&mdash;under
the Turk there was no history. Generation followed
generation, but the day of Kossovo does not seem to the
Serbs as though it were a distant day. Do not we who
go about our business in the brilliance of the morning
sometimes linger to recall the frightful setting of the sun?
And every year the Serbian people sing the Mass for the
repose of them who died at Kossovo.... When, after
more than five hundred years, the Serbian soldiers in the
Balkan War came back to this historic plain one saw them
halting, without being ordered to do so, crossing themselves
and presenting arms.</p>

<p class="section">THE VENETIANS IN DALMATIA</p>

<p>One might argue that the Slav of Dalmatia had no
gratitude, because when Serbia and Bosnia were utterly
under the Turk, when the Slovenes of Carniola, Carinthia
and Southern Styria suffered between 1463 and 1528 no
less than ten Turkish invasions, when in the middle of
that fifteenth century the crescent floated over all Croatia
and only the fortified towns of the seacoast and the
islands remained in the Christian hands of Venice, whom
a fair number of these towns and islands had called in to
protect them, surely one might argue that it was not
seemly if the local population, Croats and Serbs, detested
the Venetians. And on hearing that not long ago an
orator in the Italian Parliament exclaimed, "I cani
croati!"&mdash;a description that was greeted with a whirlwind
of applause&mdash;you possibly might argue that the
Speaker should have reprimanded him because ingratitude
is not a quality associated with dogs.</p>

<p>As we gaze at the splendid structures, the palaces,
the forts, the magnificent cathedral of &#352;ibenik that was
begun in 1443, the loggia of Trogir and Hvar, the loggia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of Zadar&mdash;"a perfect example," we are told, "of a public
court of justice of the Venetian period"&mdash;the towers
on the old town-walls of Kor&#269;ula, as we gaze at all those
elegant and useful and robust and picturesque buildings
which bear the sign of the Lion of St. Mark, do not the
complaints of the disgruntled population of that period
tax our patience?</p>

<p>We may waive the fact that the &#352;ibenik cathedral
was left unfinished for centuries, being only completed
by public subscription under the Austrians; we may
overlook the fact that the Lion of St. Mark was sometimes
placed on a building not erected by the Venetians. This
we can see at the Frankopan Castle on Krk, and elsewhere.
But it would be unjust if we held Venice up to
blame on account of some exuberant citizens. There are
many other buildings in Dalmatia which undoubtedly
were built by the Venetians: palaces and forts and walls
and loggia which are perfect examples of a Venetian
court of justice.</p>

<p>Some one may ask why the Venetians built no churches
that were half as beautiful as those&mdash;say, St. Gris&oacute;gono
at Zadar, the cathedrals of Zadar and Trogir, and so forth&mdash;which
were constructed under the Croatian kings.
Well, the possession of such churches would have been a
source of pride to the Dalmatians (and have kept awake
the national spirit more than did the forts and loggia),
and the Venetians wanted to preserve the people from the
sin of pride. There was also a feeling that the Dalmatian
forests were a source of pride to the people. So the
Venetians removed them. They were able to make use
of the wood for their numerous vessels, for the foundations
of their palaces, and as an article of export to Egypt
and Syria.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Then some one else may ask about the schools. One
must confess that the Venetians built no schools. But,
nay dear sir, contemplate the curious carving round the
windows of that palace, and then there is that perfect
example of a Venetian court of justice. Was it not unreasonable
for some of the Dalmatians to be discontented
it they and their countrymen were allowed no schools,
seeing that one did not need a school in order to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
eligible for the army or commercial navy, which were the
professions open to the natives of Dalmatia? With
regard to those natives who really wanted to have a
University diploma&mdash;well, the University of Padua was
prepared to grant one without an examination; the
"overseas subjects" could become doctors of medicine
or of law on the simple production of a certificate from
two doctors or two lawyers of their country, stating that
the candidate was a capable person. Thereupon he was
allowed to practise&mdash;in Dalmatia. And Venice herself
was disposed to grant privileges, such as an exemption
from all taxes, to those noblemen and burgesses and
highly placed clergy who were well disposed to her. But
as for schools, she could not ignore an anonymous work
of the end of the sixteenth century, which was attributed
to Fra Paolo Sarpi, the learned councillor of the Republic;
he warned them in this book that "if you wish the Dalmatians
to remain faithful to you, then keep them in
ignorance," and again: "In proportion as Dalmatia
is poor and a wilderness, so will her neighbours be less
anxious to seize her."</p>

<p>With regard to roads&mdash;how could Venice be expected
to build roads? They might have been of service to
the population of the interior, but they would have
caused a certain number of those people to devote themselves
to trade, and thus would have prevented them
from guarding the land against the Turk, which was the
unquestioned duty of a man who lived in the interior.</p>

<p>When the Venetians retired from Dalmatia in 1797,
after holding it for three to four hundred years, the
country as a country was not flourishing. The total of
exports and imports was such as would now satisfy a
single large trader. But, of course, the land possessed
those buildings with the Lion of St. Mark upon them&mdash;which
were possibly put up with the idea of enhancing
the prestige of the Republic&mdash;and it possessed the loggia.</p>

<p>In 1797 when the Austrians arrived they found in the
prisons of Zadar that, out of two hundred convicts, fifty
were beyond human punishment, and of these one had
been dead for five years. The system was that the
Government allotted to the prisoners for their subsistence
a sum that was so inadequate that they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
obliged to borrow from the warders; and when the
prisoner had served his sentence and was unable to repay
the warder, this functionary kept him under lock and
key. There in the same dungeon lay the untried and
the convicts and the insane, for whom there was no
separate habitation. It was impossible, said those who
set them free, to describe the horrors of filth, the bare
ground not being even covered with straw, the windows
being permanently closed with blocks of wood, so that
the poor inmates could never get a glimpse of the loggia,
that perfect example of a Venetian court of justice. The
hospital at Split was a damp cellar, and outside it was
a ditch of stinking water. The foundling home, which
was called <i>Piet&agrave;</i>, was a room so horrible that, out of
six hundred and three new-born children who had been
there in ten years, <i>not one had gone out alive</i>.</p>

<p>But were not these abuses general at that epoch?
And can we demand that the Venetians of that time shall
answer the reproaches which it pleases us to make?
And what answer did they give to the reproaches of their
subjects, illustrious Dalmatians, such as Tommaseo
and Pietro Alessandro Paravia, who, although belonging
to the Italophil party, passed the sternest judgment on
the authorities? What excuse could there be in 1797,
seeing that, the wars having concluded at the beginning
of the eighteenth century, Venice was free to undertake
a humanitarian and civilizing work? Venice was by
no means in a disarming state of decrepitude. On her
own lands she had brought her stock-raising, her agriculture
and her industries to such a pitch of development
that she had the experience, as well as the initiative and
the means, to do something for the Dalmatians who,
and especially in the interior, knew no other trade than
that of arms. Terrible was the desolation of those days;
over large areas there was no drinking-water; the land
was merely used to pasture the herds of almost wild
cattle; instead of the superb forests were hundreds of
miles of naked rock; and nowhere had the Venetian
families, to whom the Government had given great
holdings, come to settle down among their peasants.
Nothing at all had been done in the way of canalization
or of drainage, so that the land was devastated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
with malarial fever. In 1797 only 256,000 inhabitants
remained; a hundred years later the number had doubled.
It had much more than doubled if we take into account
those who emigrated from a land which could no longer
support the population of the early Middle Ages.</p>

<p>In 1797 the Venetian democrats begged Napoleon
not to take Dalmatia from them, since the harbours
and the population were indispensable to them. They
made no allusion to the sentiments of affection which
united these provinces to the Mother Country.</p>

<p>But are we unfair to the Venetians? Are we omitting
the salient fact that, even if they were not model administrators,
they at all events kept out the Turk, who would
possibly have been more nefarious than themselves?...
When troops were needed to fight the Turk these were
for the most part provided, in the several long campaigns,
by the Croats and Serbs of Dalmatia.</p>

<p>And what has been the fruit of all this? Let us take
an Italian writer's observations on the people of the
interior, the Morlaks.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In his book <i>I Morlacchi</i> (Rome,
1890), Signor Francesco Majnoni D'Intignano says that
they are "endowed with courage and, like all courageous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
people, with frankness. They say what they think and
their sentiments are openly displayed. Thus, for example,
they do not attempt to conceal their antipathy against
the Italians. They are no longer mindful of the benefits
which they received in the past nor of the fact that the
Venetians freed them from the Turkish yoke; and this
is so not only because of the lapse of years, but because
under the Venetian rule they did not feel themselves
independent; they saw in the Italian merely that astuteness
which knows how to profit from other people's toil,
and which has no thought of making any payment. In
the Italian they have no faith, and so their 'Lazmansko
Viro' (Italian fidelity) is equivalent to the Romans'
expression 'Greek fidelity.' But all this does not prevent
them, when they have occasion to offer hospitality to an
Italian, from offering it with every courtesy."</p>

<p>It is hardly worth while inquiring whether the
Venetians or the Turks wrought more evil against their
Yugoslav subjects. But though the modern Italian
claim to Dalmatia and the islands may appear to us&mdash;in
so far as it is based on historical grounds&mdash;to have
small weight, nevertheless we must not allow it to make us
insensible to the Venetian's good qualities. It may not
nowadays be reckoned as meritorious that, after her own
interests had been safeguarded, she did not interfere with
the privileges of the small class of nobles, the "magnifica
communit&agrave; nobile," but at any rate it could be said of
her that she left intact the local privileges. One must
also bear in mind that the majority of her subjects in
those parts had, through one cause or another, a prejudice
against innovations which could only be broken down
very gradually.</p>

<p>Nor were the Turks altogether vicious. Those who
came first into the Yugoslav lands were under a severe
discipline, and, preserving the austere habits of a warlike
race, they were not guilty&mdash;generally speaking&mdash;of
excesses. As the first comers were not very numerous,
they contented themselves with occupying the strategic
points; and as the Yugoslavs were accustomed to the
life of a State not being very prolonged, they were cheered
by the thought that their subjugation to the Turk would
fairly soon come to an end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">METHODS OF THE TURK</p>

<p>After the Turk had made himself master of Bosnia
and Herzegovina he enrolled among his janissaries 30,000
of the young men, and in other parts of Yugoslavia showed
himself inclined at first to permit the people to follow
their own traditions, their religion,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> their language and
their customs, so long as he was maintained in luxury and
so long as a sufficient supply of young men was forthcoming.
The abominable acts of cruelty, by which he is
now remembered in the Balkans, appear to have started
at a later period, when he had himself degenerated, when
his lawless soldiery provoked the people, when the people
rose and he suppressed them in a manner that would
make them hesitate to rise again. But from the first he
saw to it that there should be recruits; many a young
Slav taken early from his home was transformed at
Constantinople into a redoubtable janissary who fought
against Europeans; these troops, who were not allowed
to marry, gave an absolute obedience. They were perhaps
the finest infantry in the world&mdash;for two hundred years
they formed the strongest prop of the Turkish Empire.
Paulus Jovius, the historian, says that in 1531 nearly
the whole corps of janissaries spoke Slav. Other young
men were received into the Government offices&mdash;the
Porte, until the end of the seventeenth century, used the
Serbian language for its international transactions; its
treaties with the Holy Roman Empire, for example, were
all made out in Serbian and Greek. Finally there were
not wanting Southern Slavs who rose to high distinction
in the Sultan's service, such as Mehemet Sokolovi&#263;, who,
after being thrice pasha of Bosnia, was elevated to the
post of grand vizier; Achmet Pasha Herzegovi&#263; (son of
the last chief of Herzegovina), whose conversion was
followed by an appointment as Bey of Anatolia; he became
brother-in-law of Sultan Bajazet <span class="smcap">ii.</span> and likewise
grand vizier. There was Sinan Pasha, a Bosnian, who
constructed in &#268;ajnica, his native place, the handsome
mosque that still exists, and there was the renowned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Osman Pasvanto&ouml;lu Pasha, also of Bosnian origin, who
appeared in 1794 outside the historic fortress called Baba
Vida (Grandmother Vida), of the dusty, old rambling
town of Vidin on the Danube. Having won his way
into the fortress he was elected governor, and a year later
he became Pasha. His independence was remarkable
even at a period when Mahmud Bushatli Pasha flourished
at Scutari and Ali Pasha at Jannina, so that Lamartine
described Turkey in Europe as "une conf&eacute;d&eacute;ration
d'anarchies." Pasvanto&ouml;lu coined his own money, and,
amongst other exploits, placed on the outside of a mosque
his own monogram instead of the Caliph's emblem.
Therefore the outraged Sultan sent against him three
armies in succession, and each of them went back from
Vidin vanquished. The pasha was a brave and energetic
man of iron will, a great soldier and an expert architect.
He built famous places of worship, whose gilded
arabesques, whose fountains in the silent courts may
bring us to meditate on one who died in 1807, three years
after the first insurrection of his fellow-Yugoslav, Kara
George. In Pasvanto&ouml;lu's great library at Vidin there
are one hundred and twelve books on scientific and literary
matters. The Pasha was venerated and was regarded
almost with dread for having managed to assemble so
many volumes dealing with other than spiritual affairs.</p>


<p class="section">THE SLAVS WHO MIGRATED</p>

<p>But, apart from the Bogomiles, the number of those who
of their own free will went over to the Turks was scanty. Far
more numerous were those who abandoned their country
and crossed the Danube to Hungary, to Transylvania, to
Wallachia, to Bessarabia, thus returning with weary hearts
to some of the places which, a thousand years before, had
seen their shaggy ancestors come trooping westward. What
they heard in the Banat, the part of southern Hungary
they came to first, must have induced a large proportion
of them to remain, for they were told by those who had
migrated after Kossovo, in the days of old George Brankovi&#263;
and of Stephen the son of Du&#353;an, that this was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
good land and that the masters of it, the Hungarians,
were much more easy to live under than the Turks.
Not that it was necessary to live under them, because
one could settle in the lands or in the towns which had
been given by some arrangement to Stephen and to
George Brankovi&#263;. These were lands so wide that all
the Slav wanderers could make a home on them; they
extended to the river Maro&#353; and even beyond it. If they
settled in one of those districts it would be under one of
their own leaders and judges, not those of the Hungarians.
There did not seem to be many Hungarians, and perhaps
that was why they wanted other people in the country,
especially now that the Turk was not far off. If anyone
decided to live under the Hungarians, that also was much
better than under the Turks; in this country of fine
horses you were not prevented from going on horseback.
Then it was much easier to speak to the Hungarians,
because a great many words in their language, particularly
the words which had to do with agriculture, seemed to be
Slav. So alluring, in fact, was the state of things in the
Banat, as these people painted it, that many of the immigrants,
in their relief and happiness, wanted to hear no
more. They scarcely listened while they were being told
about the Slav settlers, in pretty large numbers, who had
been there longer still, people who said that they had
lived there always, even before the building of the Slav
monasteries, and some of these were three or four hundred
years old, as could be proved by rescripts of the Popes.
Likewise those who had always lived there reported that
some of their own race had been great men&mdash;one had
been the Palatine of Hungary in the days when King
Stephen <span class="smcap">ii.</span> was a child, another was the Palatine Belouch,
brother to Queen Helen; and were not the monasteries
there to remind one of the leaders, the voivodas, who
liked to raise such temples so that prayers could be said
for the repose of their souls?</p>

<p>It was known that a people which professed the same
religion as themselves&mdash;"a people of shepherds," as
King Andrew <small>II.</small> called them in a decree dated 1222, the
time of their first appearance in Hungary&mdash;it was known
that these Roumanians from Wallachia were just advancing
from Caras-Severin, the most easterly of the three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
counties of the Banat, into Temes, which is the central
one. But even if they came farther west it did not
seem to matter; one had a kindly feeling for them, since
there was a good deal of Slav in their language, and if
they were averse from building monasteries, that was their
own affair. They had, it was interesting to learn, invited
a Serb, the same man who had erected Krushedol
monastery in Syrmia, to build one at least as imposing
for them at a place called Argesu, to the north of
Bucharest.</p>

<p>Thus one cannot be surprised that hundreds and
thousands of Serbs and Bulgars quitted their native
lands&mdash;they were not known to the Turks as Serbs
and Bulgars, but merely as raia of the province of
Rumili&mdash;and crossed the Danube, the Serbs going
chiefly to their own countryfolk in Banat and the lands
to the west of it, while the Bulgars went partly to the
Banat, where their descendants have won fame as
market-gardeners, but chiefly to Roumania, settling in
villages round Bucharest.</p>


<p class="section">THE CONSOLATION OF THOSE WHO REMAINED</p>

<p>Those who preferred to take arms against the Turk
had the choice either of leaving their country and entering
the service of one which was at war with Turkey or else
abiding in their own land, gathering in bodies of fifty to a
hundred men, massacring as many Turks as possible, protecting
and avenging their own people, sometimes being
killed themselves, otherwise returning to the mountains
every spring. The "heiduks," as they were called, had
the people's unbounded devotion. Their achievements,
perhaps a little touched with romance, were celebrated
in the people's songs, and as it may be of interest to
know what kind of song this people made in the period
of uttermost depression, I give overleaf a couple that
are concerned with heiduks; they are translations from
a book of mine, <i>The Shade of the Balkans</i>, which is out
of print.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The Turk had thrown aside any toleration he started
with. The Patriarchate of Pe&#263;, which they had for a
time left intact, was now abolished and was not again
permitted until 1557, when its re-establishment was due
to the efforts of Mehemet Sokolovi&#263;, the grand vizier
from Bosnia, who raised to the Patriarchate his brother
the monk Macarius. Every school in Serbia and Bulgaria
was closed, so that no teaching could be given anywhere
save in the monasteries; it is said to be a fact&mdash;I have it
from Dr. Zmejanovi&#263;, lately Bishop of Ver&#353;ac&mdash;that
when Kara George, the beloved and illiterate heiduk,
made his first insurrection, there were, in addition to
the monks, precisely eight individuals in Serbia&mdash;their
names are recorded&mdash;who could read and write. Thus
the absence of printing-presses was not greatly felt: in
Bulgaria there was now no press at all, in Serbia a few
prayer-books were roughly printed in the monasteries;
but in the sixteenth century the monks, for the
copying of these books, had reverted to the use of
pen and ink.</p>

<p>There had been in the bygone days, in the empires
of Simeon and Du&#353;an, for example, a privileged class,
commonly called an aristocracy, which as elsewhere had
arisen from the people having been obliged to submit
themselves to military discipline.... And it was in
those dreary days when all the raia felt themselves as
brothers<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> that the Serb and Bulgar planted that democracy
which flourishes among them now. They saw what
dangers threatened in the towns. Vuk Karaji&#269;, the reformer
of the Serbian language, tells of certain merchants
there who, by assuming Turkish apparel and customs,
came to be no longer counted as Serbs. And more
numerous by far were the townsfolk, nobles and merchants
and others, who went to live among the countryfolk
and intermarried with them, and produced a people
which is better described not as a democracy, but as an
aristocracy.</p>

<p class="section">GOOD LIVING IN HUNGARY</p>

<p>And always we hear that those in the Banat and those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in the still more fertile province of Ba&#269;ka, to the west of
it, or those who had gone even farther west, into the wine-growing
hills of Baranja, had no reason to regret their
enterprise. King Matthew Corvinus of Hungary writes
to the Pope on the 12th of January 1483, informing him
that 200,000 Serbs have come into the Banat and Ba&#269;ka
since 1479. He adds that he is favourably disposed
towards them, as they are a fighting race of the first
order, so that he can trust them to defend those provinces
against the Turk.... Not only, therefore, did he bestow
upon them exceptional privileges, but in 1471 he appointed
Vuk, the grandson of George Brankovi&#263;, to be Serbian
despot of southern Hungary. This newly organized
dominion on the left bank of the Danube and the Save
was much more important than those of Transylvania
or of Szekeliek, which were held by Hungarian magnates
and which, in the event of war, had to furnish, each of
them, four hundred horsemen, whereas the Serbian
despot undertook to furnish a thousand.</p>

<p>The earliest Serbian settlement in Baranja appears
to have consisted of natives of the Morava valley who
came in 1508 to a district near Ciklos. The king made
over the castle of Ciklos to their leader, Stephen Stiljanovi&#263;,
called the Just, and when the Turks broke into Baranja
they murdered him. History<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> relates that some years
after this on the 14th of August the pasha, a man of
Serbian origin, commanded that the corpse be exhumed;
whereupon a ring on the dead man's finger proved that
he was related to the pasha. According to the Turkish
rules of that period it was illegal to celebrate the Mass
except at night, and in the open air. Now every year
on the night of the 14th of August a Mass is sung, with
the congregation holding torches and candles, out on the
side of a hill. Afterwards they dance, and so forth.</p>

<p>However, it was the Banat to which the Serbs chiefly
rallied, and after the fall of the fortress of Belgrade in
1521 they came in such multitudes that large portions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of it had an exclusively Serbian character. And they
were given the sole charge of defending it, while the
Hungarians retired to the north. But Hungary herself
went down at the terrific battle of Moh&aacute;cs&mdash;10,000 Serbs
under their voivoda, Paul, fought in the Hungarian
ranks&mdash;and after the fall of Buda-Pest the political
organization of the Serbs, with a despot as their ruler,
came to an end, being replaced by a religious organization,
at the head of which was the restored Patriarchate of
Pe&#263;. The diocese which the Patriarchs from their not
very accessible monastery were supposed to administrate
included all the Serbs between Monastir and Buda-Pest,
and from the Adriatic to the Struma River. It was
at this time that in the other Yugoslav lands, to the
west and north, there came a breath of wind from the
Reformation.</p>


<p class="section">THE PROTESTANT INFLUENCE</p>

<p>When the German reformers tried, by way of the
Yugoslavs, to reach Rome, they found a printing-press
at Urach, from which, between 1561 and 1564, a number
of books in Glagolitic characters (and in Cyrillic, a special
form thereof) were issued. The most cultivated of the
Glagolitic clergy in Istria and the Croatian littoral, such
as Antony Dalmatin, Primus Trubar the Slovene and
George Juri&#353;i&#263;, were enthusiastic in seconding the press
and in seeking, as writers, to disseminate Protestantism
in the Slav world. One of their most notable fellow-workers
was Matthew Vlaci&#263; (Mathias Flacius Illyricus),
professor at the Universities of Wittenberg, Jena, Strassbourg
and Antwerp, a veritable encyclop&aelig;dist of the
Reformation, and, with Luther and Melanchthon, one
of its leaders. A very distinguished man, who had
already, about 1550, joined the Protestant Church, was
Peter Paul Vergerius; before 1550 he had twice been
Papal Nuncio in Germany, a bishop in Croatia and afterwards
in Istria. The rank and file of the Glagolitic
clergy received these books with joy, for the Roman
hierarchy, which had small liking for this truly national
Church, would have been glad to see it perish in ignorance,
with no books and no culture. By the way, the lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
clergy remained what they had been&mdash;a national clergy.
They availed themselves of these Glagolitic books from
the Protestant press, but for that reason were not going
to become Protestants. Theological subtleties were repugnant
to them, and before and after the Council of
Trent they married and lived a family life.</p>


<p class="section">DUBROVNIK, REFUGE OF THE ARTS</p>

<p>The intellectual life of the Yugoslavs would, but for
Dubrovnik, have died out altogether. And even at
Dubrovnik, of which the Southern Slav thinks always
with pride and gratitude, there was a movement to turn
away from the Slav world. This was certainly one of
the periods, which reappear not seldom in the story of
Dubrovnik, when it seemed that miracles of wisdom
would be wanted for the steering of the ship of State.
Venice and the Turkish Empire were as two tremendous
waves that rose on either side. By a very clever show of
yielding, the little Republic had for a time disarmed the
Turks, and, later on, when the Venetians declared that
all the commercial treaties existing between the Dalmatian
towns and Turkey were void, it was necessary for
Dubrovnik also to accommodate herself to this enactment
and to restrict her trade to Spain and the African coast.
It would under these circumstances be most imprudent,
so urged some of the citizens of Dubrovnik, if they were
officiously to advertise their relationship to the hapless
Slavs, who were enslaved to the Republic's mighty
neighbours. And in 1472 the Senate had directed that
within its walls no speeches should henceforth be made in
Slav. But as the Senate consisted of forty-five nobles,
and these were obliged to be over forty years of age, one
may say that they did not represent what was most virile
in the State; at all events, this isolated tribute to expediency
may for a time have been observed in that assemblage,
in the world of letters it was disregarded. And this is
the more wonderful when we remember that Dubrovnik
had from Italy a language that was already formed, she
had Italian models and printers and even their literary
taste. But &#352;i&#353;ko Men&#269;etic and D&#382;ore Dr&#382;i&#263;&mdash;both of
them nobles, by the way&mdash;started at once to write verses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in Slav; not very sublime verses, as they were principally
love-songs of the school that imitated Petrarch, but it
is pleasing to recall that they were written in spite of
the thunders of Elias Crijevi&#263;, a contemporary renegade.
Under the name of Elias di Cerva this gentleman travelled
to Rome, where he made himself a disciple of Pomponius
L&aelig;tus and once more modified his good Slav name into
&AElig;lius Lampridius Cerva, and received at the Quirinal
Academy the crown of Latin poetry. Having thus
qualified himself to be a schoolmaster, he went back to
Dubrovnik and settled down to that profession. He was
likewise very active as a publicist on the "barbaric"
Slav language, which, as he was never tired of screaming,
was a menace both to Latin and Italian. One is apt to
call those persons reasonable, among other things, whose
opinions coincide with one's own; but is there anybody
willing to assert that because the Slav culture of that
epoch was, like many another culture, inferior to the
Italian; because the Italian towns were in the rays of
artistic glory, whereas the Slav world was not; because
on that account the Slavs were wise enough to profit from
the Italian masters; is there anyone who, because some
of the Slavs were and are unwise enough to be more Italian
than the Italians, will assert that the Slav has no right
to develop a national art, a national State?</p>

<p>It is superfluous to make a catalogue of those Ragusan
writers who were more or less successful in purging their
Slav language of Italianisms. Luckily they had at their
doors the language of Herzegovina, which is unanimously
considered by philologists to be the purest of the Serbo-Croat
dialects. The most considerable of these writers
was Gunduli&#263;, although he never could forget that his
productions must be pious, and, beyond all other aims,
present a moral. It was in Poland that he saw the
liberator of the Southern Slavs, and what he sings in
Osman, his chief work, is the overthrow of Sultan
Osman <small>ii.</small> by Vladislav, heir to the Polish throne. As
this poem of the seventeenth century, this flowering of
the Slav spirit, might be looked upon as assailing "the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
integrity of the Turkish Empire," it was only allowed to
circulate in MS. until 1830. According to Dr. Murko,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Professor of Slav Language and Literature at the University
of Leipzig, this work surpasses Tasso's <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>;
but it is commonly thought that there is more
literary merit in Gunduli&#263;'s <i>Dubravka</i>, a lovely, patriotic
pastoral. The worthy Franciscan Ka&#269;i&#263;,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> who followed
him with a work&mdash;<i>Familiar Conversations on the Slovene
Nation</i>&mdash;would perhaps be regarded by us as more remarkable
for his originality; but this patriotic production,
in verse and in prose, didactic, chronological, allegorical
and epic, has made him immortal. Beginning with
Teuta, the first king of the Slovene nation, who flourished,
says the author, about the year 3732 <small>B.C.</small>, he proceeds
imperturbably and sometimes in moving numbers to
relate the lives and virtues of all the other Slovene kings,
be they Bosnian, Croat, Serbian, Bulgarian; it may well
be that the secret of his vogue is, in the words of the critic
Lucianovi&#263;, that "he was less a minstrel of the past than
of the future." On the fruitful island of Hvar (Lesina)
there arose an exquisite lyric poet, Luci&#263;, whose romantic
drama <i>Robinja</i> (The Female Slave) is said to have great
importance in the history of the modern theatre; but
the most famous of Hvar's poets was Hektorovi&#263; (1487-1572).
"This nobleman with his democratic ideas,"
says the Russian savant Petrovski in speaking of his
<i>Ribanje</i> (Fishing), "is the intimate friend of his fisher-folk,
the singers of national songs, and with his remarkable
realism he was three centuries before his time." When we
finally note that at Zadar in the sixteenth century there
was written <i>Planine</i> (The Mountains), in which Zorani&#263;
gave us the most patriotic work of medi&aelig;val Yugoslav
literature, we may say at least that the Dalmatian Yugoslavs
did not abandon hope.</p>

<p>By the way, these remarks on the Slav literature of
Dalmatia may be thought otiose, for the national aspirations
would not have been less fervent if they had been
expressed in Italian. One is reminded by the well-known
Italian writer, Giuseppe Prezzolini,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> that until last century
the ruling classes of Piedmont spoke French; Alfieri and
Cavour had to "learn Italian," but who would on this
account pretend that Piedmont is a French province?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>There is really nothing strange in the fact that the Pan-Slavist
newspaper <i>L'Avenire</i>, published at Dubrovnik from
August 1848 until March 1849 by Dr. Casna&#269;i&#263;, was written
in Italian, or that those Irish who desire to be free from
their hated oppressor have not completely given up the
use of his language.</p>


<p class="section">HOW SHE SMOOTHED HER WAY</p>

<p>We have alluded to the caution of Dubrovnik, and one
must confess that in her story are such parlous situations,
out of which there was apparently no rescue, that in
reading of them one is more and more astonished at her
customary enterprise. How did she succeed, for instance,
in contributing thirteen vessels to the fleet which Charles <small>V.</small>
sent against Tunis in 1535 without disturbing in the
slightest her good relations with the Sultan? All that
she asked for was peace, and so she paid a large sum to
the Sultan every year, as also to the pirates of Barbary,
so that she could continue to navigate freely; in the
fifteenth century she had three hundred ships that were
seen in all parts of the Mediterranean and even in England.
She had been wont to pay five hundred ducats a year to
the Kings of Hungary, and now and then, when it was
opportune, she sent this tribute to the Austrian Archdukes,
the rightful heirs of Hungary. To the captain of the Gulf
of Venice she dispatched every year a piece of plate, to
the King of the Two Sicilies she presented a dozen falcons,
with a very respectful letter, and the Pope, who was not
forgotten, overlooked her annual tribute to the Turk and
proclaimed her to be the outer defences of Christianity.
(Let it not be forgotten that in 1451, four centuries before
Wilberforce's anti-slavery campaign, the Republic by a
vote of 75 out of a total of 78 forbade its citizens to traffic
in slaves, and declared all slaves found on its territory to
be free. "Such traffic," it said, "is base and contrary to
all humanity ... namely, that the human form, made
after the image and similitude of our Creator, should be
turned to mercenary profit and sold as if it were brute
beast.")</p>

<p>But of all the markets of the merchants of Dubrovnik,
those which from the days of old they most frequented,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
were the markets of the Balkans. To Bulgaria and Serbia,
Albania and Bosnia, they brought the products of the
West and of their own factories: the cloth and metal
goods, the silver and gold ornaments, the weapons, axes,
harness, glass, soap, perfumes, southern fruits, fish oil
and herbs; and most of all they valued their monopoly
of salt, a most remunerative privilege. As they could
not obtain sufficient of it in their own immediate territory,
the Senate made a regulation that each vessel which came
back after a voyage of four years must bring a cargo of
salt. This was Dubrovnik's chief source of revenue until
the end of her independence in 1808, and efforts that were
made by others to break down this monopoly led to bitter
conflicts. With regard to the goods which they carried
home with them from the Balkans, these comprised cattle
and cheese, dried fish from the Lake of Scutari, hides
of the wolf and fox and stag, wax, honey, wool and rough
wood-wares, and unworked metals. Some of the Balkan
mines, such as the silver mines of Novo Brdo in Serbia,
they worked themselves, even as the Saxons whom we
find thus engaged in various parts of these lands. Under
the Turkish domination it must have been with joy that
the caravans from Dubrovnik were welcomed, bringing
news of the one Southern Slav State which remained
free and prosperous. A good many of these wandering
merchants took Serbian or Bulgarian wives.</p>


<p class="section">HER COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE</p>

<p>If the men from Dubrovnik were able to bring happy
tidings of their own Republic, such as the report, perhaps
a little exaggerated, that the wealth of those who lived
in the street of merchants, which runs parallel to the
stately thoroughfare, the Stradone, amounted to a hundred
million ducats, they were able to give very little news of
the more distant Southern Slavs. The Serbs had not
forgotten that brothers of theirs were living in the north-west.
If in the days of the Turkish oppression they had
been inclined to be oblivious of the Croats, yet they could
not but remember that Du&#353;an's sister had married the
Croatian prince, Mladen <small>III.</small> There is no incident connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
with Du&#353;an that is not treasured in the memory of
the Serbs.</p>


<p class="section">HER NORTHERN KINSMEN AND THE MILITARY FRONTIERS</p>

<p>For a long time the Habsburgs had been planning to
employ the Croats, who were excellent troops, as a bulwark
against the Turks. And although Ferdinand of
Habsburg, on being elected to the throne of Croatia on
the 1st of January 1527, had sworn to respect the ancient
rights and traditions of the realm, his heirs favoured more
and more a policy of centralization; and in 1578, taking
advantage of a serious agrarian conflict between nobles and
peasants in Croatia, the Habsburgs instituted the Military
Frontiers, the famous Vojna Krajina, one for Croatia
proper, with Karlovac as capital, the other for the adjacent
Slavonia, with the capital at Varazdin. Croatia's
autonomy was ignored.</p>

<p>This method of guarding the frontiers had been
employed by the Romans, who made over lands to non-commissioned
officers and men on condition that their
male descendants rendered military service. Those men
who had no children received no lands. Alexander
Severus, who introduced this arrangement, used to say
that a man would fight better if at the same time he were
defending his own hearth. Under Diocletian the "miles
castellani" or "limitanei," as they were termed, had
slaves and cattle allotted to them, so that the land's
development should not be hindered through lack of labour
or on account of the owners losing the physical capacity for
work.</p>

<p>The Habsburgs were assisted in their scheme by various
causes, one of which was the poverty of the soil in certain
parts of Croatia, so that it came as a relief to many of the
struggling inhabitants that for the future they would be
provided for. The greatest misery was also prevalent at
this time in consequence of the plague which desolated
parts of Croatia and Istria. The distress was particularly
acute in Istria, where between the years 1300 and 1600
the plague was rampant on thirty-nine occasions, the
town of Triest being visited in ten different years between
1502 and 1558; and in the year 1600 the port of Pola was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
reduced to four hundred inhabitants. Venice attempted
to colonize the desert places with Italian farmers, but
having failed on account of malaria and the lack of water,
she called in a more vigorous element, the Slav from
Dalmatia and Bosnia. Meanwhile the towns, in which
were the descendants of those who had come from Italy
in the days of the Roman Empire, fell more profoundly into
decay. Those western towns looked on the Slav with disdain,
they would not mingle with the rural population;
but as these were much more active and were often strengthened
by fresh immigrants, one thought that they would
gradually swamp the more effete men of the towns. And,
on the other hand, the townsmen weakened their position
by continually breaking, on account of economic disputes,
the ties between themselves and Venice. And as example of
their frequent attitude towards Venice, we may take the
words which the deputies of Triest used in 1518 in the
presence of the Emperor Maximilian: "We would all
of us prefer to die," they said, "rather than to fall under
the domination of Venice." Such language may, of course
have been a compliment; and yet it does not seem unlikely
that the people of Triest had some knowledge of
the ruin and death that were overtaking all the Dalmatian
towns with the one exception of Dubrovnik, which was
independent.</p>

<p>Allusion has been made to the Slavs who came from
Bosnia; one may ask how it was that the Turks allowed
them to depart. On such an extensive frontier it would
not be difficult for people to escape; that they did so is
made evident by all the solemn treaty clauses which
declared that they should be forthwith delivered to their
rightful owners. The Turks were quite as ready to bind
themselves in this fashion. There is, for example, the
treaty which settles what travelling expenses the Venetians
are to pay to the emissary of the Pasha of Travnik on his
way to Zadar, how much velvet, how many loaves of
sugar and how many pots of theriac must be provided for
each member of his entourage; and in the same treaty
it is laid down that the Turks are to give up all those who
have deserted to them, yea even if they have become
Muhammedans. But the Turkish authorities never heard
of any such <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: inserted a missing period after 'people'">people.</ins> And the Slavs were passing to and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
fro from one Yugoslav land to another, always thinking
that in the new land life must be more tolerable.</p>


<p class="section">THE OPPRESSIVE OVERLORDS OF THE YUGOSLAVS</p>

<p>Now and then we hear of insurrections; thus the Serbs
of the Banat revolted in 1594, allied themselves to Prince
Batthory of Transylvania and offered him the Serbian
crown. With an army of Serbs and Hungarians the
Prince appeared on the Danube with the intention of
aiding the Bulgars. He won a splendid victory over the
Turk, but in gaining it he had exhausted himself, and the
Turk took his usual revenge. In Croatia the absolutist
policy of Leopold <small>I.</small> exasperated the people to such an
extent that they forgot their quarrels with the Magyars
in order to be able to defend their rights against the
attacks of Vienna. The Hungarian-Croatian magnates,
amongst whom were the Croats Peter Zrinsky, the Ban,
and Christopher Frankopan, conspired to overthrow the
Habsburgs. When the plot was discovered the conspirators
were executed in 1671 at Wiener Neustadt.
In the spring of 1919, when the bones of these two patriots
were brought back to Croatia and buried after a series
of imposing and most moving ceremonies, Austria
was in such a state of hunger that she waived her good
taste and received what she had exacted for the bones,
namely, five hundred trucks of meat and potatoes.
After the battle of Vienna in 1683 both Serbs and Bulgars
rose, for it seemed to many hopeful people that the Turk
was on the point of dissolution. There was an outbreak in
the Bulgarian mountain village of &#268;iprovtsi, but this was
suffocated with such ferocity that for more than a hundred
years the Bulgar would not make another effort. The
spirit of the Slav appeared to have gone out of him. Wars
that were disastrous to Turkey brought the Russians to
the Danube and the Austrians to within twelve leagues of
Sofia, but the Bulgar stayed at home with his black
memories. A better fortune attended the Serbs who
flocked to the standard of George Brankovi&#263;, a descendant
of the old despots, in the Banat. With the goodwill of
Leopold <small>I.</small> they fought by the side of his own troops,
and after these latter were withdrawn, in consequence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the new campaign against Louis <small>XIV.</small>, the Serbs continued
to wage war with the Turks, and so successfully that
Leopold became anxious lest Brankovi&#263; should found an
independent Serbian State. He therefore caused him and
the leaders of his army to be captured. Brankovi&#263; was
brought, a prisoner, to Vienna. He survived in captivity
at Eger for twenty-two years.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>


<p class="section">THE GREAT MIGRATION UNDER THE PATRIARCH</p>

<p>In the year 1690 there happened the vast exodus of
30,000 Serbian families who migrated across the Danube
and the Save under the leadership of the Patriarch of
Pe&#263;, Arsenius &#268;arnoevi&#263;. An oleograph of a picture
illustrating this event is found in almost every Serbian
house, be it private house or Government building.
These refugees settled in Syrmia, Slavonia, the Banat
and Ba&#269;ka, and received from the Emperor certain rights,
such as that of electing their voivoda (duke), of owning
land, and so forth; their privileges were not always
respected, but the Serbian immigrants remained faithful
to Austria.... The land of Pe&#263;, from which the
Patriarch fled, with the neighbouring Djakovica and
Prizren, became Muhammedan Albanian territories.</p>

<p>[Mr. Brailsford<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> in 1903 found that in these parts the
Albanian was overwhelmingly predominant, and that he
refused to tolerate the claims of the Serbian minority.
Saying that his race, descended from the Illyrians, was
the most ancient in the Peninsula, he objected to this
particular region being called Old Serbia simply because
it was once upon a time conquered by Du&#353;an. In 1903
the Serbs of the district of Prizren and Pe&#263; numbered
5000 householders against 20,000 to 25,000 Albanians.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>As for the towns: "In Prizren," said an Albanian, "there
are two European families, while the soil of Djakovica
is still clean."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The life which these people led was one
of misery&mdash;tribute in some form or other had to be given
to an Albanian bravo, who made himself that family's
protector, and, in spite of that, the holding of any property,
house or land or chattels, seems to have depended
on Albanian caprice, and the physical state of the Serbs
was wretched, through lack of nourishment and disease.
Various efforts had been made to render the land more
endurable for those who were not Muhammedan Albanians;
for example, a Christian <i>gendarmerie</i> was introduced,
but as they were not allowed to carry arms they spent
their useless days in the police stations. They filled
the Albanians with scorn, and made them shout more
vociferously their cry of "Albania for the Albanian
tribes!" Under these conditions it says much for the
stamina of the Serbs that they persisted in their old faith;
a certain number&mdash;Mr. Brailsford came across some of
them in the district of Gora, near Prizren&mdash;have been
converted to Islam, but in secret observe their old religion.]</p>

<p>A Serbian historian, Mr. Tomi&#263; of the Belgrade
National Library, has now discovered that these uncompromising
Muhammedan Albanians are not&mdash;as previous
Serbian and other historians have written&mdash;descended
from Albanians who flowed into the country because of
its evacuation by the Patriarch Arsenius and his flock.
When the Austrian armies penetrated to this region in
the winter of 1689-1690, the Imperialists were on good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
terms both with the Serbian Orthodox people whom
they found there and with the Albanian Catholics; but
after the death of Piccolomini on the 8th of December
(which was followed by that of the Catholic Archbishop),
his successor, the Duke of Holstein, alienated the people,
and when they would not obey his commands he set fire
to their villages, this alienating them completely. The
fortune of war then turned against the Austrians, who
were compelled to retreat, and the Serbian Patriarch,
with his treasury and a number of priests and monks,
fled with them. They hoped that this exodus was to be
of a temporary character, but in 1690 the Imperialists
had to continue their retreat, taking with them across
the Save and the Danube not only the Serbs who had, like
Arsenius, sought refuge in Serbia, but a far more numerous
body whose domicile had always been Serbia itself.
What tells against the theory of the 30,000 families from
Pe&#263; and Old Serbia is the fact that the Turkish troops
followed so closely on the heels of the Austrians that the
Patriarch and his clergy had great trouble in escaping
themselves, and in addition to the Turk there was the
difficulty of those mountain roads in the middle of winter.
Thus it seems likely that most of the Serbian population
of what is called Old Serbia remained there. The previous
historians, who say that such a vast number followed
the Patriarch and his priests, have based themselves, it
appears, on the notes and chronicles of those priests.
And the people, deprived of the guidance of their priests&mdash;who
were then the spiritual and lay and military leaders&mdash;found
it difficult to stand out against conversion. Half a
century before this a great many Catholic and Orthodox
Serbs of those parts had embraced Islam, in order to
escape the financial and military burdens which were
laid on Christian men; the women and girls would continue
to profess Christianity. This phenomenon is described
by many travellers, such as Gregory Massarechi, a Catholic
missionary for Prizren and the neighbourhood, who says
in his report of 1651 that in the village of Suha Reka
on the left bank of the White Drin there used to be one
hundred and fifty Christian houses, but that he only
found thirty-six or thirty-seven Christian women, the
men having all gone over to Islam. People were wont to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
come secretly to him for confession and to communicate;
he tells how these converted men would marry Christian
women, but would leave them Christian all their lives,
and only on his deathbed would a man ask his wife to be
converted also.</p>

<p>The Prophet had also found his way into many households
of Montenegro, where the clans, with neither civil
nor military government, had been compelled, for their
protection, to live in a patriarchal fashion: the people&mdash;that
is, the chiefs of the clans&mdash;elected a bishop and
gathered round him as the champion of their religion
against Islam. Until the time of Danilo (1697-1737)
there had been fourteen bishops. During his reign the
problem of Turkish penetration was taken in hand.
It was intolerable that Montenegrin families should stand
well with the Sultan because one of their members had
gone over to Islam. The small, untidy village of Virpazar,
by the Lake of Scutari, has got a certain fame, because
the chosen men who were to purge the country of this
evil started out from there on Christmas Eve in 1703.
Those who participated in the "Montenegrin Vespers"
were not likely to forget the incidents of that impressive
ceremony. The Bishop celebrated Mass, and from the
consecrated tapers in his hand the people lit their own.
Every man was armed. They knelt&mdash;their tapers hardly
trembling&mdash;and they kissed the sacred image which the
Bishop held. Then he blessed their weapons and they
sallied forth, running round the lake and climbing up
the rough, long road to Cetinje. Every house was visited
in which there was a Moslem, and the choice was given of
repudiation or of death. With such missionaries and with
subjects such as these to work upon, you could not hope
that the negotiations would be quite pacific. Many of
the Moslem, young and old, were slaughtered, and when
Mass was sung on Christmas morning in the rugged, little
monastery of Cetinje, many of the chosen men assembled,
weary but content, and gave whole-hearted thanks to
God that Montenegro had been liberated from the
scourge.</p>

<p>As for those who came under the influence of Islam in
Old Serbia, they were left after 1737 even more to their
own resources, as the zone which united them to the main<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
body of Serbs was depleted by another great exodus,
under Patriarch Arsenius <small>IV.</small>, &#352;akabenta. But, although
these men of Serbian origin preserve sometimes this or
that peculiarly Serbian custom, yet, as Mr. Tomi&#263; says:<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
"Living together with the Muhammedan Albanians, they
have assumed the Albanian type and become the most
savage foes of the Orthodox religion and of the people
from which they are sprung. The popular saying," he
adds, "is right which asserts that: 'A Christian become
a Turk is worse than a real Turk.'" Of course, in order
to make it appear that he was a real Albanian, there was
always a tendency for an Albanized Serb to be preternaturally
oppressive. And up to a short time ago it was
very cold comfort for the Serbs to learn that many of
these people are of Serbian ancestry. But, as we shall see
further on, the old, medi&aelig;val friendship between the
Serbian and Albanian rulers is extending to the people,
and this&mdash;provided that a sinister external pressure can
be warded off&mdash;will bear good fruit.</p>

<p>On behalf of the afore-mentioned 30,000 families the
Patriarch negotiated with the Habsburgs and obtained
very far-reaching rights, which permitted the Serbian
people to form in Hungary a <i>corpus separatum</i>. A point
which to Serbian eyes had extreme importance was the
institution of a National Congress, to sit at Karlovci on
the Danube in Syrmia, and, amongst other functions, to
designate the Patriarch, whose seat was to be (and remains
to this day) Karlovci, where a friendly white village on
the rising ground, which anyhow would make it famous
for the red wine and plum brandy, has received in its
midst the marble palace of the Patriarch, a gorgeous
church and various magnificent red and white buildings
which look like so many Government offices but are, in
fact, devoted to Church affairs, the training of theological
students and so forth. Their Patriarchate at Karlovci
appeared to the Serbs as the rock of their nationality
outside Serbia. The Constitution granted to them did not
make them precisely a State within a State, but at least
it set up a political-religious unity&mdash;for the privileges
included those of having a chief, the voivoda, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
having a certain territory with autonomous internal
organization and exemption from all taxes. Here the
Serbs, forming a separate and distinct group, with their
own religion, calendar and alphabet, and with their own
aspirations, would be able to stretch out their hands&mdash;prudently,
of course&mdash;to their scattered brothers. So
the Serbs began to whisper to the Croats of the ancient
days; the Croats heard them gladly, but they could not
stop another voice from whispering as well. They had
lived for so long with another religion, another civilization,
their eyes had been turned in other directions, their
hearts been filled with other hopes. And now it was as
if the modern voice was being interrupted by the ancient
voice. The Croats were inclined to ask the interrupter
to be silent, but they found they could not live without
him.</p>


<p class="section">ACTIVITIES OF THE SOUTHERN SLAVS UNDER THE HABSBURGS</p>

<p>In the Banat and elsewhere under Habsburg rule the
Serbs were filling their accustomed part and fighting,
now against the Turk and now against Rakoczi's insurrection,
during which, between 1703 and 1711, they are
said to have lost about a hundred thousand men. Prince
Eugene of Savoy, in whose campaigns they took a large
share, described them as "his best scouts, his lightest
cavalry, his most trusted garrisons." And they are
rewarded&mdash;Joseph <span class="smcap">i.</span>, making use of very chosen phrases,
insists on the merits of the Serbs and confirms their
privileges. And until the Treaty of Pojarevac these
privileges are maintained immune. This treaty came
at the conclusion of the 1716-1718 war against the Turks;
it put the Banat in the hands of Austria, who made it
a Crown-land, with military government and autonomous
administration. From this time onward the country,
which had had an exclusively Serbian colouring, begins
to receive an influx of strangers. The German governing
class introduce Germans from the Rhine, from Saxony,
from W&uuml;rtemberg, Bavaria, Upper and Lower Austria
and Tirol. Not only are these colonists settled in some
of the most fertile parts, but Vienna also makes enormous
grants of land in the Banat to lofty military personages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and to families of the aristocracy, and these in their turn
assist the immigration of Germans.</p>

<p>But before the Habsburgs could continue in their
efforts to assimilate, by one process or another, the
Southern Slavs in the Empire, it was necessary to induce
them to accept the Pragmatic Sanction, for Charles <small>VI.</small>,
the reigning Emperor, had lost his only son and wished to
secure the succession to Maria Theresa. It is interesting
to see that Croatia negotiated independently of Hungary,
that she recognized the Pragmatic Sanction in 1713,
whereas the Magyars did not do so until 1733. Consequently,
if the Emperor had died between these two dates
Croatia would have been separated completely from
Hungary. Maria Theresa would have become Queen of
Croatia, but the Magyars would not have been obliged
to place themselves under her. The Croats on this
occasion declared that the crown of Croatia was to pass
to that member of the House of Habsburg who should
reign not only in Austria but also in the other hereditary
Austrian lands, for the Croats wanted publicly to show
that any separation from the Slovenes of Carniola,
Carinthia and Styria would be far less endurable for them
than separation from Hungary. "It is neither by force
nor yet the spirit of slavery," they said, "that we have
been put under the domination of Hungary; we have
submitted ourselves voluntarily, and not to the royalty
but to the king of the Hungarians."</p>

<p>The Serb and Croat element in the Austrian army was
at this time greater than the sum of all the others, and,
owing to the privileges which their services acquired for
them, they came to be regarded with extreme suspicion
by the Magyars. It was under Magyar influence that
Maria Theresa abolished the Croatian council, confided
its functions to the Hungarian Government, and, on the
same occasion, in 1779, proclaimed the town of Rieka
(Fiume), with its surroundings, to be "<i>separatum sacr&aelig;
regni Hungari&aelig; coron&aelig; adnexum corpus</i>." Rieka, like
Triest, had been a free town under the Habsburgs, the
reason being that they were the chief arteries of trade,
so that a greater freedom was desirable. Like Triest,
Rieka does not appear up to this date to have shown any
hankering for Venice, and Maria Theresa's diploma which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
renews the freedom is hardly evidence, as some people
have asserted, that the town was throbbing with Italian
sympathies.</p>


<p class="section">THE POSITION OF THEIR CHURCH</p>

<p>More and more Germans were being brought into the
Banat, and to make room for some between Teme&#353;var
and Arad the Roumanians, who had settled there, were
transferred, in 1765, to the western county of Torontal.
About half a century before this the Roumanian Bishop of
Transylvania, with most of his clergy, passed from the
Orthodox to the Greek Catholic Church; those of his
flock who did not follow him attached themselves to the
Serbian Church, and after a considerable time were given
by Joseph <small>II.</small> in 1786 a Roumanian bishopric, at Sibiu.
This bishopric was placed under the administration of
the Serbian Patriarch at Karlovci "<i>in dogmaticis et pure
spiritualibus</i>," which seems to show that the other privileges
of the Serbian Church did not extend to the Roumanians.
The Serbs had, from the beginning of the thirteenth
century, been founding monasteries, and, although about
twenty were secularized or affiliated to others by Maria
Theresa, yet there remained eleven in the Banat and
one, Hodosh, to the north of the Maro&#353;; and as the
Roumanians had no monasteries at all they were received
as guests in some of these. And so things continued for
about a hundred years.</p>


<p class="section">SERBS ASSIST THE BULGARIAN RENASCENCE</p>

<p>While the Serbs were flourishing, ecclesiastically, in
the Banat, the Bulgars had been painfully keeping alive,
until 1767, their lonely Patriarchate at Ochrida. Time
and again the Greek Patriarch at Constantinople had tried
to suppress it, at first on account of cupidity and afterwards,
say the Bulgars, for fear lest it should help to
arouse the Bulgarian national spirit; but that spirit had
fallen to such a depth that the second edition of a comparative
lexicon of the Slav languages, which was issued,
at the behest of the Empress Catharine in 1791, makes
no mention of Bulgarian, and in 1814 the Slavist Dobrovsky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
regarded Bulgarian as a form of Serbian. And
yet, say the Bulgars, the national spirit survived so
wonderfully by those far waters of Macedonia that even
when the Greek language was introduced into the offices
and the Church administration, and when Greeks had
usurped the throne of St. Clement, they still found it
possible to stand out for the independence of their Church,
which handed on the memories of the Bulgarian past.
We must be allowed to be sceptical&mdash;the town of Ochrida
in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is
said by contemporary writers to be now in Serbian, now
in Bulgarian, now in Macedonian territory. And the
very observant Patriarch Brki&#263; of the eighteenth century
tells us, in a calm, passionless description of the diocese,
which he wrote in exile&mdash;he was the last Patriarch of
Pe&#263;&mdash;that the inhabitants of a place called Rekalije, in
the district of Djakovica, are not Albanians but Serbs and
Bulgars who had been, a short time before, converted to
Islam. It seems probable that the sharp divisions of
Serb, Bulgar, and so on, did not then exist, and that the
Greek Patriarch at Constantinople did himself not know
what variety of reprehensible Slav it was that lived in
those parts.... The last Patriarch of Ochrida, whose
name was likewise Arsenius, spent the remainder of his
life in exile at Mt. Athos, and there, in another monastery,
was a pale, sickly monk, poring over crabbed MSS. This
Pa&iuml;ssu, a Bulgar, had entered, like his elder brother, the
great Serbian monastery of Hilendar. We know from him
that while the various Orthodox monks of Mt. Athos&mdash;Greeks,
Bulgars, Russians, Serbs and Vlachs&mdash;were frequently
at loggerheads, yet the others even more frequently
combined to fall upon the Bulgars and to upbraid them
because their history had not been glorious and because
they had an insufficient number of saints. The Bulgar was
nothing but a servant of the Greek; Bulgarian was no
doubt written in a monastery here and there, but as for
the spoken language, were not the townsfolk often ashamed
of it? Did they not prefer to talk Greek? "I was filled
with sadness," says Pa&iuml;ssu, "on account of my race."
There happened to be at Hilendar the monk Obradovi&#263;,
who was less enthusiastic about Glagolitic than about
the songs sung by the peasant. With the fundamental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
thought of working for the whole people, including the
women, he clung to the idea of a literature in the popular,
rather than in the old Church language. He was to set
out, in pursuit of Western science, to France and Italy
and England&mdash;he spent six months in London. The
whole people was dear to him; he looked beyond their
differences of religion, their other differences, and saw
the brotherhood, in race and speech, of all the Southern
Slav countries. He was to become one of the great inspirers
of modern Serbia and her first Minister of Education.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
He urged young Pa&iuml;ssu to travel among his
countrymen in search of manuscripts and legends. If only
he could find the buried splendour of his people and call
it into life again. And before he died&mdash;he suffered from
continual headaches and an internal malady&mdash;he had
finished, in 1762, his book, <i>Slav-Bulgarian History of the
Bulgarian People and Rulers and Saints</i>. This naif, imperfect
book, more lyric than scientific, but sincere and
impassioned, has played a part in reminding the Bulgars
of their story; it is the fountain-head of the Bulgarian
Renascence.</p>

<p>In Serbia the gallant Captain Kot&#269;a also tried to
begin for his country a Renascence. Russia and Austria
declared war against the Turks in 1787. The Serbian
volunteers, who included Kara George, crossed the
Danube and fought with great courage. Yet the Austrians
were beaten and Kot&#269;a was captured, by treachery, in the
Banat; he was brought back to Serbia and impaled
with sixty of his comrades. But in the treaty of 1791
the Turks undertook to give autonomy to the Serbs
of the Pashalik of Belgrade, and to keep from their lands
in future the janissaries who had wrought so much
mischief.</p>


<p class="section">THE GERMAN COLONISTS IN THE BANAT</p>

<p>Further down the Danube, though, there would be a
janissary watching a frontiersman, a Grani&#269;ar, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
opposite bank, waiting to kill him&mdash;both of them Serbs,
both standing on Serbian land.... The military frontier
regiments were not only organized to defend, in a long
line, Croatia, Slavonia, Ba&#269;ka and the Banat from Turkish
inroads, they had also to fight for the Habsburgs wherever
a war was toward. Two centuries ago, at the time when
the Serbian regiments were in a privileged position&mdash;the
entire regiment, officers and men, consisting of Serbs,
and their own arms being on the flag&mdash;it was their destiny
to go to France, Italy and Spain, as afterwards to the
battle of Leipzig and to Schleswig-Holstein. They
may have grumbled a good deal on the way to all these
battles, but once the fighting had begun they grumbled
no more, thus resembling in two respects the French
soldier. And this practice of going abroad on behalf of
the Empire was continued till the frontier regiments,
about fifty years ago, were broken up. Thus Joseph
Eberle and George Huber were killed during the Italian
campaign of 1848-1849. These men were German
colonists, whose introduction had been so much encouraged
in the eighteenth century. But, in order to
separate Protestant Hungary from the Turks, so that the
two should not unite against the Catholic Habsburgs,
it was laid down by Prince Eugene that all the German
colonists had to be Catholics. Some Protestants managed
to settle in Lescovac, where they held secret services
during the night; but in 1726 this was reported to the
Prefect of Bela Crkva, whereupon he sent word that if
they would not be converted they would each receive
twenty-five strokes with a birch.... Of course, those
who lived on the frontier lands were subject to the same
conditions as their neighbours. German frontier regiments
existed side by side with Serbian regiments, and
the life of all those people can be studied in a book<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
written by the German frontier village of Franzfeld and
published in 1893, a few months after Franzfeld had
celebrated its centenary. There would, no doubt, be
variations enough in the domestic arrangements of Franzfeld
and those of Zrepaja, the neighbouring Serbian
village, some miles away; but, as the inhabitants of
Franzfeld have now been gathered into Yugoslavia, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
not without interest if we see what sort of a life they have
led. The tale of how these Lutherans from W&uuml;rtemberg
laid out and constructed and painted their village,
with all the tremendously broad, tremendously straight
roads running parallel and at right angles to each other,
with the church&mdash;whose decorations are a few stars on the
ceiling&mdash;the pastor's house and the lawyer's and the town
hall and other important houses standing round a square
of mulberry trees in the middle of the place&mdash;the tale of
all this is told in as deliciously matter-of-fact a manner
as <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. The picturesque, as in that book,
startles us now and then, with a vivid scene&mdash;until 1848,
we are told, at the arrival of a staff-officer or of a general,
every bell in the place had to be set ringing and gunpowder
had to be fired off. One finds oneself revelling
in the minuteness of the descriptions, one follows happily
or sadly the fortunes of Ruppenthal and Kopp and Morgenstern.
Everything is true, for the compilers of the
book have felt, like Defoe, that "this supplying a story
by invention is certainly a most scandalous crime." We
are given all the names of those who at the beginning
occupied the ninety-nine houses&mdash;the hundredth being
used as an inn&mdash;with their place of origin, the numbers of
their male and female dependants, and by what means
they had hitherto earned their bread. Many houses have
been added since that time. Among all the Germans,
house No. 79 was occupied by George Sir&aacute;ky, a Hungarian
who had been a peasant. Ten years afterwards another
list is made and Sir&aacute;ky still disposes of the same twenty-four
"yoke"<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of plough-land, ten of meadow and one
of garden, which he had originally been given, whereas
some of the others had increased or diminished their
holdings. Then we lose sight of him, and his name does
not become one of those which reappears in succeeding
generations. Of course, the colony was established on a
military basis; an officer, usually a lieutenant, with one
or more non-commissioned officers, was stationed there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
as the representative of a commandant who presided
over several villages. The resident officer was supposed
to maintain law and order, to see to it that the people
sowed their land at the right season, and to inform the commandant
of any delinquency, for the lieutenant was not
allowed to punish anyone. As one or more of the able-bodied
men belonging to a house might be absent for a
long time on military service or in captivity, or else
through sickness or wounds be unfit to work, and through
lack of means the householder not be in a position to hire
day-labourers, in that case his fellow-villagers, one after
another, were obliged to assist him without payment.
In order that all possible respect should be attached to the
chief man and woman of a house&mdash;the house-father and
house-mother&mdash;these were not liable to punishment for
small offences, and if a considerable offence made it
necessary to punish them, then they were first of all
deposed from their position. Various public posts were
filled by the house-fathers or other men, and for refusing
to accept such a post a man was commonly arrested;
but this punishment, as well as that of so many strokes
with a cane (which seems to have been the most usual
penalty), was abolished by 1850. The military frontier
system came to an end in 1872, at which time the communal
life, which had been found to be very irksome, was
also gradually done away with. Franzfeld is now a
prosperous and peaceful place; their horses are well
known, they breed excellent cattle and pigs and sheep,
and they say of themselves that out of one Franzfeld
man you can make a couple of Jews and there will still
remain a Franzfeld man. They tell how once or twice a
Hungarian Jew has opened a shop in the village, selling
his goods very cheaply for two or three months, at a lower
price, in fact, than he paid for them, and then putting
up the prices; but as soon as he does that he is boycotted.
The aliens who have settled in Franzfeld&mdash;Hungarians,
Slovaks and Roumanians&mdash;have come as servants, have
married Franzfeld girls and are looked upon as Germans.
The same German dialect is spoken as in W&uuml;rtemberg;
troops from that country marched through Franzfeld
during the War. But Serbian, the villagers told me, is
the international language of at any rate western Banat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in spite of the Magyars who, as in other parts, made for the
last few years of their domination extreme efforts on behalf
of their unlovely language. They supplied Franzfeld
with schoolmasters and mistresses who could speak no
German and no Serbian, so that it was very difficult for
both sides. And the authorities told the pastor that the
chief truths of religion, they considered, should be taught
in Hungarian. But the pastor did not agree with them
and they let the matter drop. Franzfeld has seen wild
days, particularly in 1848, and her one monument records
a calamity of two of her sons who vanished down a well
which they were sinking. Of itself the land is not very
fertile, but the people have been so successful that they
have founded a colony, Franzjosephsfeld, in Bosnia&mdash;they
multiplied too greatly for their own soil to support
them. They speak, many of them, five languages, and
they will not be the least worthy of Yugoslav subjects.
[Their interests are much more agricultural than political.]
With regard to their multiplication, by the way, it is
related in this centenary book, among much curious
information, that when another Franzfelder comes into the
world it is usual to present certain largesse to the midwife,
namely, one gulden (this was written in Austrian times),
a loaf of bread, a little jar of lard and a few kilograms
of white flour. In the old military period this personage
was also, like the doctor and the schoolmaster, "on the
strength." The last of those who bore the rank of Company-Midwife
was Gertrude Metz; she was pensioned
after thirty-eight years, and continued for a few years in
private practice.</p>


<p class="section">THE SOUTHERN SLAV COLONISTS AND THEIR RELIGION</p>

<p>The Magyars, being themselves of at least two religions,
did not interfere in the religious matters of those
whom they called "the nationalities" save to ask, with
more or less firmness&mdash;it made a difference if they were
dealing with Protestant Slovaks or with Protestant
Germans&mdash;that the language of the ruling race should be
employed. This comparative toleration was, of course,
tempered by exceptions. Thus in the very Catholic
city of Pe&#269;uj in Baranja the treatment applied to other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
religions depended on the individual bishop. Bishop
Nesselrode, for instance, chased them all away, and until
1790 they were seldom permitted within fourteen kilometres
of the town.</p>

<p>The Austrians in the eighteenth century constrained
a good many Southern Slavs to enter the Church of Rome.
Austria has always been rich in faithful sons of the Church.
Some years ago, for example, I happened in various
parts of Dalmatia and Herzegovina to be from time to
time the travelling companion of an elderly Viennese.
He told me how he had lately impressed upon the mother
of his illegitimate son that the boy must receive a thoroughly
Catholic education, and in every place this
gentleman made his patronage of an hotel dependent on
the proprietor's religion, which he frequently knew before
we got there. I saw him last at Mostar in distress, because
the only good hotel was administered by an Israelite
of whose religion he disapproved, and the weather, as it
often is at Mostar, was so oppressingly hot that I suppose
he had not energy enough to try to convert him....</p>


<p class="section">BUNJEVCI, &#352;OKCI AND KRA&#352;OVANI</p>

<p>Perhaps Austria would not have displayed such fervour
in creating Bunjevci, &#352;okci and Kra&#353;ovani if she had
known that these Roman Catholic Slavs would remain,
on the whole, very good Slavs. The Bunjevci, who live
for the most part in Ba&#269;ka and Baranja, came originally
from the Buna district of Herzegovina. The total population
of the town of Subotica is 90,000, and 73,000 of these
are Bunjevci, whose peculiarity is that the old father stays
in the town house, while his sons, with their wives and
children, drive out on Monday morning over that rather
featureless landscape to the farm, which may be at a
considerable distance, and there they remain till the end
of the week. They are a quiet, industrious people who
have lived withdrawn, as it were, from the world since
the twenty-five or thirty families escaped from the Turks;
and as they brought with them only that number of
surnames it is now customary to add a distinguishing
name. Thus the Vojni&#263; family has divided into branches,
such as Vojni&#263;-Heiduk, Vojni&#263;-Kortmi&#263;, Vojni&#263;-Pur&#269;a.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
The Bunjevci seem, although Catholics, to incline less to
the Croats than to the Serbs, some of whose customs&mdash;those,
for instance, of Christmas&mdash;they share. But in
merry-making they are a great deal more subdued, save
that, in drinking to some one's health, you are expected
to empty three glasses. In the intervals of a Bunjevci
dance at Subotica men would promenade the room arm-in-arm
with men and girls with girls. The faces of all
of them express entire goodness of heart and absence of
guile; many of the girls, who looked like early portraits
of Queen Victoria, were arrayed in the local costume,
which permits great variety of colour so long as the lady
wears, I am told, about fifteen petticoats. These worthy
people used to have nothing but their Church, and are
now extremely religious. The man who has most influence
over them is Bla&#353;ko Raji&#263;, a priest and deputy,
who was not always able to prevent a Hungarian Archbishop
from sending a priest to his church, where he held
services in Magyar. During one night, at all events, this
church caused the Magyars much annoyance. It was
at the beginning of the Great War&mdash;they had accused
Raji&#263; of making signals from the tower, which is very
high; and in order to prove their accusation they sent
a large body of soldiers, who surrounded the church, on a
boisterous winter's night. Sure enough, the signals were
seen to be flashing up there. The church was locked and
a blast of the bugles had no effect&mdash;save that a few
Bunjevci looked out of their windows&mdash;for the flashes did
not cease. Then the captain commanded his men to
give a mighty shout: "Put out those lights! Put out
those lights!" But not the least notice was taken.
There was nothing to do but to wait until Raji&#263;, or whoever
it was, should finish his nefarious business and come
down. About an hour later, though, the wind became so
piercing that a non-commissioned officer suggested that
the captain should send for the big drum; the noise of
that, said he, would surely reach that devil in the tower.
But the big drum, when it came, had no success. The
noise it made, reinforced by those of the bugles and the
men's shouting, was such that some Bunjevci dressed
themselves and ventured out into the cold, to see what
really all the turmoil was about. To one of them the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
freezing captain yelled that he knew perfectly the criminal
had heard them, and that he went on with his accursed
flashes since he recognized that this would be the last
base act that he would ever do on earth. For the remainder
of that night the captain and his men, not with
the hope that they would be obeyed but merely to warm
themselves a little, kept on shouting now and then,
"Put out those lights!" And in the dawn the non-commissioned
officer discovered that the signals had been
moonlight on some broken glass that was being shaken
by the wind.... One sees in the very well-arranged
archives of the town of Sombor that the Bunjevci were
accustomed, like the Germans, to ally themselves with the
Magyars and thus give them a majority. Only in the last
ten years at Subotica (and not at all at Sombor) did they
ask for their rights; they had seemed conscious of the
religious difference between themselves and the Serbs,
unconscious that they were of the same race and language.
The Magyars attempted to show in Paris that the Bunjevci
are not Slavs, but the remains of the Kumani (who
died out in those parts about five to six hundred years
ago and were not Magyars). In the census of twenty years
ago the Bunjevci were called Serbo-Croats, in accordance
with a monograph, "Sabotca Varosh T&ouml;rt&eacute;nete,"
in which Professor Ivanji, a Magyar, said they were simply
Catholic Serbs. In the census of 1910 the Bunjevci
are put under the heading "&Eacute;gyebek," which means
"miscellaneous."</p>

<p>This census juggling by the Magyars was one of their
milder methods of administration. The term Serbo-Croat
came to be avoided, and, so that foreigners should
be misled, the Yugoslavs in Baranja were classified as
Serbs, Croats, Illyrians, &#352;okci, Bunjevci, Dalmatians
and so forth. The &#352;okci, who were also converted in the
eighteenth century to the Roman Catholic Church, are
mostly found to-day in Baranja. The name by which
they are known is derived from the Serbo-Croatian word
<i>&#353;aka</i>, the palm of the hand, and refers to the fact that the
Catholics cross themselves with the open hand, whereas
the Orthodox join the tips of the thumb and first two
fingers. The &#352;okci are considered a weaker people than
the Bunjevci; the mothers&mdash;they say it is love&mdash;are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
often so weak that they allow their children to do anything
they like at home, and would not think of remonstrating
with them if they wear their caps in church.
Among the &#352;okci none is of a higher than the peasant
class, for which reason their priests have usually been
Magyars. He who ministers to the village of Szal&aacute;nta,
however, is a Croatian poet. The mayor of that village&mdash;I
believe a typical specimen of the &#352;okci&mdash;was a ragged,
humorous-looking person with a very bushy moustache.
He was in remarkable contrast with the young Magyar
schoolmaster, whose remuneration is largely in kind.
This gentleman looked as if he would be well content if
the parents of his children sent him not eggs, butter and
chickens, but armfuls of flowers. A month before the
Hungarian revolution in 1918 an order had come from
Buda-Pest to the effect that the lowest class in a school
was to receive instruction solely in its own language, but
the Hungarian Republic ordered that no history was to
be taught, since it praises kings.</p>

<p>As for the Kra&#353;ovani, who inhabit five villages of the
mining district of Resica in Caras-Severin, the eastern
county of the Banat, they also were converted by Maria
Theresa, in whose time they fled from Montenegro,
Macedonia and the Bulgarian frontier. Gradually they
have come to reckon themselves as Croats, owing to their
priests who come from Croatia. They are all big men with
luxuriant moustaches.</p>

<p>There is a district in southern Russia, near the Black
Sea, which is called New Serbia. It is the fertile country
that was chosen by 150,000 Southern Slavs when they
preferred, in 1768, to go into exile rather than change
their religion, like the Bunjevci, the &#352;okci and the
Kra&#353;ovani. They preserve some traces of their origin,
but can no longer be considered Yugoslavs.</p>

<p>In speaking of these converts and their descendants
we have alluded to the Buda-Pest policy of enforcing the
Magyar language. This movement may be studied from
the close of the eighteenth century in Croatia, where
Latin had hitherto been the official language. In 1790
the Croats were again delivered by Leopold <small>II.</small> to the
Magyars, who were bent upon executing their designs.</p>

yielded to them, and while the more prosperous Romans settled
on the coast, the others retired to the mountains. One of the sea-towns,
by the way, to which the Romans fled was Split, where they could live
in the ruins of Diocletian's enormous, decadent palace; and from extant
lists of the mayors of that town we see that until the tenth century they
all had Latin names, from then till the twelfth century we find partly
Latin and partly Slav names, and during the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries their names were nearly always Slav. Those Romans&mdash;of
course not implying by that word that their forbears had come from
Rome or even from Italy&mdash;those refugees who took to the mountains
mingled with the Slavs and were also joined by wandering shepherds from
Wallachia, owing to whom all this variegated population came to be called
Black Vlachs, Mauro-Vlachs and in English Morlaks. The epithet
"black" was attached to the Vlachs, so Jire&#263;ek thinks (cf. <i>Bulletino di
Archeologia Dalmata</i>, Split, 1879), on account of the hordes of Black
Tartars who until the beginning of the fourteenth century infested the
plains of Moldavia. Gradually in this hinterland population the Roman
and the Vlach died out, but the latter's name was retained. It had lost
its ethnic meaning and among the Ragusan poets of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries the word was used to signify a shepherd. The
Venetians employed the word Morlacchi as a term of mockery, because
it indicated people of the mountains, backward people. And this derogatory
connotation has clung to it, so that to-day the Morlaks, who after
all are Croats and Serbs, do not like to be called by that name.</p></div>

Edith Durham must regret that in her book <i>High Albania</i> (London,
1909) she did not confine herself to recording of the men of Prizren that
"of one thing the population is determined: that is, that never again
shall the land be Serb"; but she adds, on her own account, that in this
picturesque town and its neighbourhood the Serbs are engaged in a forlorn
hope and that their claims are no better than those of the English on
Normandy. Yet if, in her opinion, the Serbs have been rewarded beyond
their deserts, she must acknowledge that they are not wholly undeserving&mdash;in

<p class="section">SLAVS WEEP FOR THE FALL OF VENICE</p>

<p>Early in 1797 the weak French garrisons which had
been left in certain towns of Italy were massacred by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Venetians, who displayed no mercy either to the wounded
soldiers or the women who were with the troops. Napoleon
would come back no more, thought the Venetians. But
he heard of what had happened as he was engaged upon
the clauses of the Treaty of Leoben. No sooner had that
courier brought him the dispatches than the Venetian
envoys were ushered into his presence. They had been
entrusted by the Senate with the task of following the
armies and congratulating Napoleon or the Archduke,
according to which of them had won the last battle.
These envoys may have taken a despondent view of what
would be the fate of the Serene Republic; but when,
a short time afterwards, the perfumed and dishevelled
citizens, stamping on the masks of last night's ball, were
weeping pitiably in their palaces, the Slovenes and the
Morlaks, who had fought for them so well, were weeping
in the streets. Sadly and solemnly at Zadar&mdash;<i>la tanto
disputata</i>&mdash;the flag of Venice was lowered; at other
parts of the Dalmatian coast the nobles scarcely had to
say a word before the peasants had snatched arms to
fight the French and their <i>&eacute;galit&eacute;</i>. The Venetians had,
after all, been there a long time, even if they had not
risen to the heights of Dubrovnik, which, as we learn
from a traveller in 1805, kept no secret police and no
gendarmes, and where a capital sentence pronounced at
the time was the first in twenty-five years. (The city
went into mourning on account of this, and an executioner
had to be imported from Turkey.) Such a moral height
had not been reached by the Venetians; but they had
been in Dalmatia, as people loved to repeat, for a long
time, and they had been easy-going in the collection of
taxes, they had supported the bishops and the holy
Church, they had made the peasants feel that each one of
them was helping to support Venice, the grand and ancient,
and so the faithful people mourned when she was falling.</p>


<p class="section">THEY HEAR THE VOICE OF THEIR BROTHERS</p>

<p>Yet they were not wholly deaf to the call of their own
race. When the Austrians sent a general, the "Hungarian
party," working against the civil government of Count
Raymond von Thurn, managed to have the post given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to General Rukavina, a Croat from the Military Frontier.
An eye-witness has left us an account of Rukavina's
reception at Trogir. The general mounted a chair, and
asked the people in the Slav language whether they
would swear the oath of fidelity to His Majesty the
Emperor and King, Francis <small>II.</small>, and his descendants and
legal successors. "Otchemo!" ["That is what we
want!"] was the unanimous reply. After the swearing
of the oath, the general suddenly began a vigorous speech:
"Moi dragi Dalmatinci" [<ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: inserted a missing opening quote in front of 'My'">"My</ins> dear Dalmatians"], said
he.... And afterwards, when two companies of Croat
infantry were disembarked, the people collected round
them were astonished to hear them speaking the same
language as themselves and to learn that many of them
had the same names as the Dalmatians.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Incidents of this character were, for more reasons than
one, most galling to von Thurn. In July the archbishop
and municipality of Split petitioned that they might
belong to Hungary. One presumes that these officials
were moved less by the sympathetic ways of one Hungarian
than by the knowledge that Croatia was under the
Hungarian crown. Very powerless, indeed, like themselves,
Croatia might be&mdash;at that moment reduced to the
rank of a Hungarian county, with her Ban no longer able
to convoke the Diet&mdash;nevertheless, a Croatia still existed.
Then Count Raymond took hold of the matter; he sent
reports on Rukavina to the Viennese authorities, and he
and they seem to have cared little whether these reports
contradicted one another. He exhibited his adversary
as a man of unbounded violence, as a man of the most
pusillanimous nature; General Rukavina was despicable,
said these documents, he was an absolute nonentity; but
no, shrieked von Thurn on the next day, this man Rukavina
was imbued as no other with the abominable spirit
of Machiavelli. To bring about the fall of the Hungarian
party in Dalmatia, Count Raymond's police set themselves
the task of laying by the heels such Hungarian agents as
Count Miaslas Zanovi&#263;, one of the four sons of Count
Anthony, who for being implicated in a more than usually
flagrant scandal had been expelled from Venice. And his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
sons lived agitated lives, although it is untrue that the
second one, Stephen, before dying in prison in Amsterdam,
had governed Montenegro and is known to history as
Stephen the Little. [That mysterious person was a
contemporary, who appearing in Montenegro when the
land was in a state of barbarism and destitution, gave it
out that he was the Russian Tzar Peter <small>III.</small>, who had been
strangled to death in 1762. The Montenegrins accepted
him; and from 1768 to 1773 he showed himself a most
competent and zealous ruler, carrying out so many reforms
that he was clearly not Peter <small>III.</small> It has not as yet been
ascertained from where he came, but judging from his
accent he was either a Dalmatian Serb or a native of
the Military Confines. He was very taciturn; only one
Montenegrin, a priest called Markovi&#263;, is believed to have
been privy to his secret. Markovi&#263; had visited Russia
ten years previously and had celebrated Mass in the
presence of the Tzar. It was the priest who assured the
mountaineers that Stephen really was the Tzar. During
his reign he repulsed the Turks and organized the public
security, so that a lost purse&mdash;the people said&mdash;could
easily be recovered. The Republic of Venice tried on
several occasions to poison this excellent ruler; he was
ultimately killed by a barber who came up to Cetinje at
the bidding of the Pasha of Scutari, and, being appointed
court barber, cut Stephen's throat.] As for the Zanovi&#263;,
the elder brother, Count Premislas, was for a long time in
a Finnish prison, on account of his conduct in gaming-houses;
the two younger brothers, Hannibal and Miaslas,
were in Budva in southern Dalmatia in 1797, distributing
Venetian proclamations, after which they rearranged
their minds and became Hungarian agents.</p>


<p class="section">MEASURES TO KEEP THEM APART</p>

<p>The more active of the pair was Miaslas, and by
confounding his machinations and those of other Hungarian
adherents von Thurn overthrew the Hungaro-Croatian
party. Thenceforward his greatest care was
diligently to suppress those aspirations of the people of
Dalmatia for a union with their brothers. He had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
build the house with the materials that he found on the
spot; the most obvious corner-stone was that numerically
small body of nobles and merchants who had for so long
associated with Venetian officials that they hated to confess
that they were Slavs.</p>


<p class="section">BY ENCOURAGING THE ITALIANIZED PARTY</p>

<p>A minute number of this small body consisted of real
Italians, people who very exceptionally had settled in
Dalmatia; but among these rare families there was not
any single one of that extensive class in Venice which had
been presented by their Government with vast domains,
with farms and forests in Dalmatia. Well, the Count of
Thurn observed that this small body of Italianized Slavs
would probably not help him very much, for the Italian
culture and the education which they were so proud of
were&mdash;it is not unjust to say&mdash;nearly always superficial
and not such as to compensate for this party's lack of
numbers. But yet, for what they were worth, he supported
them. No doubt the project which the Archduke
Charles evolved in 1880, to transplant German-Austrians
to Dalmatia, would have been preferred by von Thurn.
"These colonists," explained the Archduke, "by their
culture and laboriousness, by their devotion to the House
of Habsburg would give to the Dalmatians a most valuable
example and would soon persuade them thoroughly to
merge themselves among the mass of peoples faithful to
the Emperor." But this plan could not be carried through,
because the people of Dalmatia would have risen in revolt;
moreover, the most fertile regions had been so neglected
that too many of them were now marshes or through
other causes uninhabitable. Thus von Thurn assisted
the Italianized party; they would, at any rate, unlike
the other Serbo-Croats of Dalmatia, not strive for union
with anybody else. Before the French Revolution no
one in Italy dreamed that it would be possible to bring
about Italian unity, and the patriots of 1848 longed only
for the liberation of their Peninsula; they spoke of Triest
as "the port of the future Slavia" or as "a neutral zone,
a transitional region between Slavia and Italy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">AND THE ORTHODOX CHURCH</p>

<p>It may be that when von Thurn also gratified a
reasonable ambition of the Orthodox Church he was moved
by the idea that the Roman Catholic Church of the Croats
might thus to some extent be counteracted; he may, on
the other hand, have been impelled by altruistic motives
when he authorized the establishment of an Orthodox
bishopric. Under Venice the Church had not been recognized;
and after having several times almost succeeded
in obtaining their bishop, a <i>modus vivendi</i> was at
last reached in 1797, with the consent of the Senate and
perhaps of Rome. Under this arrangement the Orthodox
were free to profess their religion, but the Senate officially
ignored their separation from the Roman Church; their
priests had to obtain their rights from the Catholic bishops
and allow the Catholic priests to cull certain of their
legitimate revenues. And this, although the Orthodox
formed one-half of the dioceses of Scardona and &#352;ibenik,
and two-thirds of that of Bocche di Cattaro. They were
not more backward than the rest of the population. Von
Thurn&mdash;who, they thought, knew nothing of the circumstances&mdash;was
informed by them that the see of Dalmatia
was vacant and that they had elected the Archmandrite
Simeon Ivcovi&#263;, a man universally esteemed for his prudence
and wisdom. They begged von Thurn to confirm
this election, and he did so.</p>


<p class="section">AND BY FATHERLY LEGISLATION</p>

<p>But von Thurn seems to have relied largely on the
gratitude which this neglected province would feel for the
introduction of Austrian improvements. The happy-go-lucky
Venetian methods were no longer to disfigure the
country. Those people were logical indeed who did not
care for a government which did not care for them. No
such reproach should be levelled against the Austrian
Government, if he could avoid it; for in Dalmatia it
would now be by the side of its new subjects from their
getting up in the morning until they lay them down at
night. Henceforward there would be a set of reasonable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rules for everything, and if anyone remarked that this
was too much in the spirit of the late Joseph <span class="smcap">ii.</span> who made
the Kingdom of Prussia his model&mdash;what more excellent
model could one imagine? Those people who had
hitherto been troubled in their minds because they did not
know how many flower-pots they might instal outside
their windows, to those people it would be a boon to have a
new list of detailed and complete regulations as to every
aspect of this matter. People who had until now been
nervous lest they would be punished if they started
lotteries at Zadar, all these people would be glad to know
that lotteries were legal if each person who manipulated
one paid for the upkeep of a hundred lanterns in the
streets. People had been bastinadoed in the past, not
knowing if they would be smitten hard or gently; but the
Austrian Government was far too civilized to leave such
matters in the hands of chance. With regard to those
who persisted in public smoking, von Thurn probably
borrowed the rules which Baron Codelli, the mayor of
Ljubljana, was elaborating at this time. "In the streets
of the town and the suburbs," says the Baron, "smoking
has become of late a general practice. The pleasure of
smoking tobacco, which its partisans can sufficiently
enjoy in their abodes, by the river and in the fields, makes
them forget what is seemly, and, moreover, they disregard
the peril that may arise from conflagrations, especially
when their pipes are not shut. Several fires, due to this
pipe-smoking, which is contrary to the police regulations,
have not sufficed to lead the culprits back to the respect
and precaution which they should preserve for the goods
and property of their fellow-citizens. To satisfy the
general well-being and to satisfy the police with regard to
fires, it is forbidden to smoke tobacco, and especially cigars,
in the streets and squares of this town and the suburbs,
with the penalty of losing the pipe if a police-agent catches
anyone with it in his mouth, and in the case of a repeated
offence the penalty will be more serious."</p>


<p class="section">IN SERBIA THE PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM</p>

<p>This system of tutelage may have had its irksome
moments; the Turkish rule in Serbia was such that any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
people with blood in their veins were bound to rebel.
Sooner or later a race like the Serbs, who lived always
with the songs of their old heroes and who gloried in
their heiduks, were sure to dash themselves against this
alien master. Kara George had seen that the Serbs in
the Banat were prosperous, while in Serbia they were
obliged to stand and watch the janissaries come back to
the pashalik of Belgrade, though the Turks had sworn
this should not be. Then the match was set to the fire&mdash;in
January 1804 the Da-Hi, the chiefs of the janissaries,
after having slain Mustapha Pasha, the enlightened
Turkish Governor, who was known affectionately as
"the mother of the Serbs," cut off the heads of a number
of Serbian leaders; seventy-two of them on pikes were
made into an awful avenue of trees. But even as the
snowstorms beat against these Serbian heads, so Kara
George and his companions from &#352;umadija, the heart of
Serbia, flung themselves against the janissaries and
vanquished them. This was what the Serbs had started
out to do, and so for the moment Constantinople had
been content to look on. However, when the Sultan
was told that his unruly vassals had seized the whole of
&#352;umadija and the departments of Valjevo and Pojarevac,
he sent against them the Pasha of Bosnia, who demanded
that they should lay down their arms. But now the
Serbs had seen what some day they might struggle to&mdash;the
liberation of their country. They had climbed a
few steps up the stony path, they would not let themselves
be lured back to the plain. Let Austria or some other
one of the Great Powers guarantee their rights. The
Pasha would not hear of it, and so these few undaunted
men resolved to fight the Turkish Empire. An army
came at once to stamp them out, and at Ivancovac they
scattered it. From now they would fight on alone.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Their leader was the sort of man they wanted, a brave
heiduk who was never weary, who had taken up one day
a large rock and had flung it down a precipice, and who
would do the same, they fancied, to a follower of his, if
he saw fit.... The Serbs were left to fight alone, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the Great Powers took an interest in their future. We
find in a report from the French Ambassador in Petrograd
to his Minister of Foreign Affairs (No. 261 in the "Excerpts
from the Paris Archives relating to the history of the
first Serbian Insurrection," collected [Belgrade, 1904] by
Dr. Michael Gavrilovi&#263;, now the Minister in London)
that the treaty of alliance stipulated for Russia to have
Moldavia, Bessarabia, Vallachia and Bulgaria; France
to have Albania, part of Bosnia, Morea and Candia;
Austria to have Croatia and part of Bosnia; while Serbia
was to be independent and given to a prince of the House
of Austria or to any other foreign prince who married a
Russian Grand Duchess. According to another scheme
which the Ambassador forwarded, Austria was to have
Serbia in complete possession as an Austrian province,
and Croatia to belong to Austria or France, as Napoleon
might decide.... Serbia had to fight alone, and unluckily
her ranks were anything but closed. The lack of
education brought about some childish jealousies, such as
that of Mladen Milanovi&#263;, who was ordered by Kara
George to go to the relief of the Heiduk Veliko at Negotin,
where 18,000 Turks were besieging him. "He may help
himself!" quoth Mladen. "<i>His</i> praise is sung to him
at his table by ten singers, <i>mine</i> is not. Let him hold
out by himself, the <i>hero</i>." Veliko sent word to say that
at the New Year (when Kara George and his chieftains
were wont to meet in consultation) he would inquire as
to how the country was being governed. But before
then he was dead&mdash;shot by the Turks, who recognized
him while he was going the rounds; and after five days
his troops, in despair, made their escape across a morass
and scattered.</p>


<p class="section">THE MONTENEGRIN AUTHORITIES ARE OTHERWISE
ENGAGED</p>

<p>There was no use in looking to the Montenegrin
mountains, for that rallying-point of all the Serbs was
in the midst of very delicate business. One year before
the rising of Kara George, in 1803, the Montenegrin
warriors had profited from the fact that they were fighting
nobody and they had made a few reforms in their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
country. The Bishop, Peter <small>I.</small>, convoked an assembly
at which the tribal chiefs approved of a Code and of the
imposition of a tax, for State requirements. It was also
decided to have a court of justice, the members of which
should be elected by the people. Thus it will be seen
that the patriarchal system still prevailed, and though
the Bishop was regarded by the outside world&mdash;by the
Turk whom with varying fortunes he was perpetually
fighting, and by the Russian Tzar, whom he had visited
at intervals from the time when Peter the Great called on
the Montenegrins in 1711 to work with him in rescuing,
if it was God's will, those Orthodox Christians who were
oppressed by the yoke of the heathen&mdash;though the Bishop
was regarded both by friend and foe as the sovereign of
Montenegro, yet it was only round him that the tribal
chiefs gathered as being the guardian of their religion,
while the people, represented by their tribal chiefs,
remained the real sovereign. If Kara George had risen
one year earlier they would have flown immediately to
help him&mdash;as, indeed, they did help him at a later period&mdash;they
would have postponed, without a moment's hesitation,
the establishing of Code and tax and court of justice.
But in 1804 they found themselves in a most awkward
situation. Since the death of the Tzar Paul the Russians
had appeared to be indifferent to Montenegro, and for
three years the annual subsidy of a thousand sequins
had not been paid. This omission was made use of by
the French Consul at Dubrovnik, who with the aid of a
Dubrovnik priest, one Dolci, set himself to wean the
Montenegrins from their Russian friendship. Fonton,
Russia's Consul at Dubrovnik, demanded the sequestration
and the scrutiny of Dolci's papers; the demand was
rejected, and when force was tried Dolci leaped at the
examiner's throat. It was proved that he was in the pay
of France and the Montenegrins were obliged to disavow
him. This exasperated the Bishop, who threatened to
cut off Dolci's ears, but relented and only gave him a
hundred blows with a stick and ordered him to be imprisoned
in a monastery. The second half of Dolci's
punishment was thought by many at the time to be
unwise, as he might talk. And they were gladdened when
they heard, soon afterwards, of his decease, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
whether they were right in praising their bishop for this
consummation we do not know. At all events, the hapless
Dolci had not lived in vain, for Russia now resumed her
good relations with the mountaineers, and she inaugurated
them by paying the three thousand sequins.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 allotted Dalmatia to
Napoleon. A few months afterwards his armies landed
on the coast. Although the high command and certain
regiments were French, a large part of the force consisted
of Italians, Germans, Spaniards and Dutchmen. The
scheme Napoleon entertained was to secure for himself the
gates of the Balkans and Albania, incidentally to take
the Ionian Islands in the rear, with the great purpose of
securing the roads to Constantinople; thence to India.</p>


<p class="section">NAPOLEON FAVOURS THE SOUTHERN SLAVS</p>

<p>The provinces of Dalmatia and Istria were placed
under the government of Milan, in their towns were
hoisted the Italian colours; but if to Napoleon these
lands were chiefly stepping-stones to India, he did not
long stay in ignorance regarding their inhabitants. His
representative, Vincenzo Dandolo, was a Venetian who, on
account of his democratic principles, had been expelled in
1799 and had sought refuge in France. We will therefore
not repeat the epithets he uses when he writes about the
late Venetian overseas r&eacute;gime. But Napoleon had no
cause to be prejudiced in favour of the Yugoslavs. His
origin was Italian. His daughter reigned in Italy. And
if he had disapproved of Dandolo starting at Zadar in
1806 an official newspaper&mdash;the <i>Regio dalmato: Kraljski
dalmatin</i>, written partly in Italian, partly in Serbo-Croat&mdash;he
would very soon have stopped the paper and Dandolo's
career. But, on the contrary, this paper (the first
one to be written at all in Serbo-Croat) was followed by
the planning of secondary schools at Zadar, &#352;ibenik,
Trogir, Split, Makarska and the island of Hvar, twenty-nine
elementary schools for boys and fourteen for girls,
two academies at Zadar and Split, four seminaries for the
education of priests and eight industrial schools. And
in these the Serbo-Croatian language was to be largely
employed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Kara George had no leisure in which to learn to read
and write. Another Turkish army, formed in Bosnia,
had to be encountered near &#352;abac in 1806. It was routed,
and on this occasion the Serbian cavalry was led with
great distinction by a priest, Luka Lazarevi&#263;. Yet another
Turkish army suffered the same fate.</p>


<p class="section">RUSSIA AND BRITAIN OPPOSE HIM ON THE ADRIATIC</p>

<p>It was not to be thought that France would be left
tranquil on the Adriatic. Russia did not incommode
her very greatly. After Kotor (Cattaro) had been
delivered to the Muscovites by an Italian, the Marquis
Ghislieri (who had concealed until that moment his
antagonism to the French for having been removed by
them from his Bologna home), the Russians made themselves
obnoxious to a small extent upon the islands.
They summoned the people of Hvar to recognize the Tzar
as their overlord, and when the people declined to do so,
the Russians bombarded them. For Dubrovnik this
conflict between Russia and France was embarrassing;
she wrote to Sankovski, the Russian Commissary, that if
he exceeded his powers she would have recourse to the
Tzar, "her beloved protector." But when in the summer
of that year, 1806, she was besieged for twenty days, the
French were in occupation of the town, while the Russians
with their Montenegrin friends were trying to dislodge
them. It is said that before the garrison was relieved, by
the arrival of another French force, there had been so
much damage done to the Republic's ancient walls and
palaces and other buildings that the loss, to mention only
the pecuniary loss, amounted to eighteen million francs.
After the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 the British undertook,
and more effectively, those operations in the Adriatic which
the Russians now abandoned. They tried to burn at
Triest the Russian vessels which had been ceded to France,
and for a few years they had command of the Adriatic,
keeping sometimes as many as twenty-two ships in those
waters, while the French are said to have had at no time
more than seven frigates.</p>

<p>The old Republic was dissolved; but many other questions
weighed upon Napoleon. It was the Austrian Emperor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and not he whom many people in Dalmatia held to
be their lawful monarch, for the Habsburg was the heir of
the Croatian Kings. And so while England had the sea in
her possession, Austria had the salt-lands of the isle of
Pago, and the populace on the Quarnero Islands took the
rudders off the boats which were to carry food to Zadar.
The Austrians advanced on Split, with ordinary troops and
volunteers. At Hvar the people kept Napoleon's birthday
with apparent enthusiasm; on the next day they revolted
and hoisted the Austrian flag. Then the peasants seized
the town and for three days indulged in pillage, burning
amongst other things the valuable libraries of those who
favoured France.</p>


<p class="section">ILLYRIA, NAPOLEON'S GREAT WORK FOR THE
SOUTHERN SLAVS</p>

<p>With the Treaty of Schoenbrunn Napoleon secured
possession of Carniola, the Austrian part of Istria, Croatia,
the military frontiers from the Save to the sea, and also
certain districts of Carinthia, Styria and Tirol. Now at
last the Adriatic littoral, with large tracts of the interior,
was united under one hand. We may note that Eug&egrave;ne
Beauharnais in vain entreated that the frontier for the
Slovenes should, on account of strategic necessities, be
drawn to the east of the Isonzo, but Napoleon did not
hesitate to make that river the boundary between the
two countries, as it was between the two races. Mazzini
in 1860 shared this opinion, which he had also maintained
in 1831, in his book <i>The Rights of Man</i>, that Slavs and
Italians should be divided by this river. And in 1860
Cavour expressed himself to the same effect in a letter to
Laurent Valerio.</p>

<p>"Mes braves Croates," says Napoleon in his Memoirs;
and for what he did in this Illyria, the forerunner of our
Yugoslavia, they must be always thankful. Never had
these people had such able administrators, such sympathetic
governors. They governed it too much as if it
were a part of France, but they were doing their utmost
to understand the people and their customs. General
Marmont acquired an excellent knowledge of the Serbo-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Croat
language; he intended to introduce the national
tongue into all the public offices. But this naturally could
not be carried through without an intervening period,
and unluckily Marmont so far excelled his compatriots
as a linguist, that when the newspaper <i>T&eacute;l&eacute;graphe officiel
des Provinces Illyriennes</i> appeared at Ljubljana, the
capital (under the brilliant editorship of Charles Nodier,
who came out from France for that purpose), and it was
announced that there would be French, German, Italian
and Slav articles, the latter do not appear to have been
published. Illyria was under the influence of its neighbours,
Italian, German and Hungarian, with regard to the
spoken and still more with regard to the written language.
A fundamental necessity was that the country should
have one common language. Under French influence
Joachim Stulli brought out his <i>Vocabulario italiano-illyrico-latino</i>
in 1810, and at Triest in 1812 Star&#269;evi&#263; published
his new Illyrian grammar. There was visible in
these works an aspiration that some day the Yugoslavs
would be united in one country and with various dialects,
and the proviso that for public affairs and for schools and
literature the so-called "&#352;to" dialect, the most widely
spread and the most perfect, should be given preference.
If Napoleon had not fallen, his Illyria would no doubt have
gradually attracted to herself the other Yugoslav provinces
that still were under the Austrian, Hungarian or Turk;
and in this way one of the great thorns would have been
taken out of Europe's side. There was an official, Marcel
de Serres, on Napoleon's staff, who was exclusively concerned
with Yugoslav affairs; and it is probable that with
a closer knowledge of the people there would have been less
insistence on the radical reforms which were sometimes ill-adapted
to the country and were often hated vehemently
by the persons whom they shook out of their age-long
comatose condition. Napoleon would have modified the
methods of recruiting had he known how much resentment
his conscription was arousing. Venice had obtained
most faithful soldiers; this was one of the few trades that
she permitted, but she had never said they were obliged
to serve. Napoleon's system caused great numbers of
desertions, while the men who stayed had little discipline
and looked for opportunities to join the enemy. Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in time the nobles would have been resigned to losing, if
not all, at any rate a portion of their privileges; and the
Catholic clergy would have moderated their strong views
against the gaoler of Pius <small>VII.</small>, the champion of liberal and
emancipated France, the master of Dandolo, who wanted to
reduce the number of bishoprics, oblige candidates for the
priesthood to learn certain lay subjects and regulate the
funds in the possession of the Orders, with the purpose of
assisting the indigent clergy and benevolent institutions&mdash;much
would have been forgiven by the clergy to the man
who brought about national union.</p>


<p class="section">NAPOLEON'S SCHEMES ARE ROUGHLY INTERRUPTED</p>

<p>The transactions of the British at Vis (Lissa) were
such as to make the people of Illyria very discontented
with Napoleon, not so much on account of his mischance
at sea, as of the disagreeable effects thereof upon themselves.
The British blockade had ruined the local merchant
service, while the consequent state of a province which
had necessarily to be revictualled by sea was compared
with the flourishing fortunes of Vis. Before the British
definitely occupied that island with its glorious harbour&mdash;2&frac12;
kilometres in length by 1 kilometre in breadth&mdash;they
had to secure themselves by two naval engagements.
In October 1810 the French-Italian attack was nearly
successful, and in the following March came the great
fight when Dubourdieu pitted himself against Commodore
Hoste. Not counting a few smaller ships, the French
had four frigates, each armed with 44 guns, and two
corvettes of 32 guns. The British had the <i>Amphion</i> and
the <i>Cerberus</i>, each armed with 60 guns, the <i>Active</i> with
44 and the <i>Volage</i> with 22. The Italians having slow
ships, arrived late, but fought very well. What lost
Dubourdieu his chances was the separation of his squadron,
which allowed the British to engage them one after
another. Dubourdieu on the <i>Favorite</i>, his captain and
two lieutenants were killed; the captain of the <i>Flore</i>
lost an arm; the captain of the <i>Bellona</i> had both legs
amputated, and died on the next day; Pasqualijo, captain
of the <i>Corona</i>, wished to surrender his sword to Hoste,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
but as he had fought so nobly Hoste refused to take it.
Pasqualijo was removed to Malta, and after a few months
set at liberty. On the British side the losses were also
severe. Most of the crew of the <i>Amphion</i> were either
killed or wounded, Hoste being among the latter. Of
254 on board the <i>Cerberus</i> only 26 were untouched. It is
said that the French and Italians had about 200 killed
and 500 wounded. Dubourdieu's fault was merely an
excess of intrepidity; the French have called a cruiser
after him. Their opinion at the time, according to their
historians,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> was that the British were superior in officers
and men and ships&mdash;constant cruising on the Adriatic
had brought them near perfection. Among the incidents
recorded is that of one of the <i>Amphion's</i> cadets who was
doing police work at the fort; in despair at being out of
the battle he swam to his ship. A fusillade from the
<i>Favorite</i> put some shot in his leg. On reaching the
<i>Amphion</i> he was bandaged and went to his post. His
name was Farell or Farewell.... After this the British
made themselves at home upon that mountainous, rich
isle of palm-trees and vineyards that were praised of old
by Agatharchides. Sir G.&nbsp;D. Robertson, the Governor,
had two companies of the 35th Regiment, besides Swiss,
Corsican and Calabrian contingents. There was great
prosperity. Sometimes a hundred corsairs would be in
the harbour, waiting for a favourable wind. On their
return they would have splendid cargoes, and the goods
which cost so little were sold at absurd prices. Rent was
high, there were not shops enough for the tailors, carpenters,
goldsmiths, pastry-cooks who landed there,
chiefly from Italy; the people therefore pulled old boats
on to the shore and lived in them. There one could buy
the best Turkish tobacco, and cigars were advertised as
"the finest cigars for gentlemen and ladies." Italian
and Dalmatian smugglers flocked to Vis in search of
goods, and even French officers could sometimes not
resist wearing the cool garments from the East Indies.
In two years the population increased from four to eleven
thousand.</p>

<p>Illyria's enemies on land were also aided by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
British. In 1813, when the Austrians, under General
Tomassich, penetrated into the Illyrian provinces, the
Croat inhabitants threw in their lot with them. They
and the British surrounded Zadar, which fell after a
siege of six weeks. At Dubrovnik&mdash;whose merchantmen
she had mostly captured or sunk&mdash;England assisted the
population, nobles and commoners, in a revolt against the
French. One object of the citizens was to restore the
Republic, but in a democratic form.</p>


<p class="section">THE MONTENEGRIN BISHOP INCITES AGAINST HIM</p>

<p>However, in the first days of 1814 the Austrians
arrived and the French, in their reduced condition, could
hold out no longer. 1813 had been a fatal year for
Napoleon. The Montenegrin Bishop had addressed a
stirring appeal to the Bocchesi and others in September.
"Slavs!" he wrote. "Glorious and illustrious population
of the Bocche di Cattaro, of Dubrovnik and Dalmatia!
Behold the moment to seize arms against the
destroyer of Europe, the universal foe who has attacked
your religion, ruined your churches.... He has put
his taxes on the blood of your veins and even on the
corpses of your parents! What injustices has he not
committed?... Behold the hour of vengeance....
Croatia is delivered, and Carniola, Triest, Istria, Rieka
and Zengg. What else do you wait for, O valiant Slavs
of Dalmatia, of Dubrovnik and of Kotor? By land the
army of the Emperor of Austria, by sea that of the King
of England enter Dalmatia. They have taken Zadar
and have arrived at Makarska." ... [The Austrians,
as a matter of fact, entered Dalmatia a month after this
proclamation was issued. The Bishop has allowed the
prophet in him to prevail over the chronicler.] "I am
there," he continues, "with my Montenegrins, ready to
go where peril has to be faced. The glory of the traitor
Bonaparte has remained at Moscow and Smolensk: no
longer need we tremble before the Tyrant....</p>

<p>"Given at our Headquarters at Budva, 12/24
September 1813. <span class="right"><span class="smcap">Peter</span>, Bishop."</span></p>


<p class="section">DISASTER FOR NAPOLEON AND THE SOUTHERN SLAVS<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>1813 was a fatal year for Napoleon and for this first
attempt to build a Yugoslavia. It was a fatal year for
the first effort to construct again a Serbian State. Burning
with the hope of liberation, no less than four Serbian
armies had assembled and advanced victoriously against
the Turk. One of the most outstanding episodes was the
heroic death of Stephen Sindjelini&#263; at T&#353;egar, near to
Ni&#353;. As he was in a hopeless case, no reinforcements
having come, he told his men that they must die, but as
the Turks outnumbered them so more of these must
perish than of Christians. He waited till the Turks
pressed closely round him and then fired the magazine.
In vengeance for this deed the Turks piled up a pyramid
of Serbian soldiers' heads; they called it Tchele-Koula
(Tower of Skulls), and for many years it was at Ni&#353; a
veritable Turkish monument. King Milan built a wall
around it; afterwards it was removed. And so the
Serbs continued their long fight. It seemed to some of
them that the authority of Kara George had grown
excessive. They convoked a national assembly, which
decided to set up a Ministry of six and a tribunal. Kara
George was&mdash;in agreement with his Ministers&mdash;to nominate
the prefects of the various departments. While the
Serbs were settling these internal matters, Russia made
her peace in 1812 with Turkey. As for Serbia, it was
arranged that the new fortresses would be demolished
and the towns be occupied by Turkish garrisons. Thus
all that Serbia had won, and at the cost of so much blood,
would now be stolen from her. Once again did Kara
George and his companions take the field, but this time
they were overpowered. Many fled to Hungary, among
them Kara George, and were imprisoned. Others stayed
in Serbia, and of these a great many were slaughtered by
the Turks. They say that sixty were impaled on each
side of the road which enters Belgrade, among <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'the'">them</ins> priests
and monks, whose bodies were consumed by dogs.</p>

<p>But Illyria and Serbia lived as inspirations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">Nearly thirty years after the Austrians came back to
Illyria they, at the request of the Sultan, forbade the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
use of that name, except as one of their Emperor's string
of titles. Turkish susceptibilities were not ruffled if he
chose to call himself King of Illyria. Was he not also
King of Jerusalem? There had been anxiety at Constantinople
as to the effect which the name of Napoleon's
province was producing on the Slavs of Bosnia. Considering
the Austrian policy, this was not a glittering
diplomatic triumph for the Turks. Had they approached
the Austrians much earlier it is improbable that they
would have been met with any very strenuous refusal.
In their own phrase, a phrase that was used by Osman
Pasha when he heard of the violent disputes between
the Russians and Roumanians as to which of them had
been the first to batter the defences down and take by
storm the mighty Plevna&mdash;"Any pig," said he, "can
walk in at an open door."</p>


<p class="section">AUSTRIA'S REPRESSIVE POLICY</p>

<p>Another item of Austria's policy which it would not
have been difficult to foretell was her refusal to countenance
the union of Dalmatia and Croatia. Von Thurn's
idea of favouring the harmless Italianized party was
thought very admirable and was now once more put into
action. This party was very much concerned to keep its
head above water; the rising tide of nationalism and
equality and of other pernicious French notions made as
much appeal to them as they did to Metternich. What
he stood out against, they also hated; for the national
spirit, fostered by the union of the two Slav provinces,
would swamp them. If Dalmatia, on the other hand,
remained autonomous they would be much more likely
to survive. So they became autonomists.</p>

<p>A fair number of those who for economical or social
reasons gave themselves out as belonging to this little
autonomous party were unable to speak Italian, being
less cultivated than many of those who continued to be
patriotic Serbo-Croats. But as Italian now became the
language of the schools and offices, of the law-courts and
of public life generally, these autonomous persons hastened
to learn it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">THE WORK OF VUK KARA&#381;I&#262;</p>

<p>But now we hear the steps of other Southern Slavs
whose mission is to call the people to their own language
and to make the language worthy of the people. With
the encumbrances that in the centuries had so disfigured
it, the archaisms and the pseudo-classicisms, it would never
come to pass that one great Serbian nation would be
formed. And that is what Vuk Kara&#382;i&#263;, throughout his
life, was aiming at. While Milo&#353; Obrenovi&#263; in Serbia
took up the arms which Kara George had dropped, and
used some others of his own, Vuk Kara&#382;i&#263; was tramping
with his wooden leg round Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonia
and Bulgaria, Syrmia and the Banat. He longs to
find out where his country lies and, having found his
people, to use their own language as the spoken and the
written language of the nation. For this purpose he had
to reform the Cyrillic alphabet, as it contained, like
Russian and Bulgarian, letters that are not pronounced;
and the Serbian produced by him is a purely phonetic
language. He had, of course, his enemies, particularly
in the clergy, who were the most important class. What
he was doing with the Pal&aelig;o-Slav displeased them hugely.
Here was he trying to substitute what they called "a
language of ox-herds" for that one which had not alone
a venerable tradition but was the hall-mark of their
superiority. A certain Dr. Haji&#263; wrote a monograph in
which he demonstrated most emphatically that it was
the enviable happiness of the Serbian people to have no
grammar. It was hinted by some other opponents of
Vuk that he might well be an Austrian agent, who, in
order to disturb the people, was now raising questions of a
most contentious nature, which had previously not been
thought of. But when the great philologist died in 1861
in Vienna he had long been recognized as one of the
most ardent patriots. His three volumes of national
songs excited the enthusiasm of Jacob Grimm, who rushed
off to learn this new language, and with essays and letters
to reveal it to Goethe. Translators, commentators,
expounders and editors flocked from all sides, and Vuk
was regarded as Serbia incarnate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">THE METHODS OF SERBIA'S MILO&#352;</p>

<p>One naturally judges a country of which one is ignorant
by the little which one knows about the private life of its
ruler. And it was fortunate for Serbia's reputation that
Prince Milo&#353; had a Vuk to throw a shadow over him. Kara
George had been a hero, Milo&#353; called himself a statesman.
Anyhow, he walked in crooked paths, although the
murders that he was accused of are now said to be not
proven&mdash;with the exception of Archbishop Nik&#269;i&#263;, one
of his critics, and another prominent man whom he requested
the Pasha to have strangled. Kara George&mdash;one
finds in many books&mdash;was done away with when he
came back to renew the fight against the Turks; most
people say that Milo&#353;, his arch-rival, had him murdered
in his sleep. All that one knows for certain is that the
assassin was a man in the employ of one of Milo&#353;'s prefects.
As for Milo&#353; sending the head to the Sultan, it is pointed
out that as the Sultan's vassal he could not do otherwise.
But the stories of his wife, the strong-minded Princess
Liubica, are acknowledged to be true&mdash;how she would cry
out to the warriors, if they seemed to waver, that they were
but women, and how this induced them to attack again;
how she would cook her husband's meals and wait on
him; how when she discovered that any other lady had
found favour in the Prince's sight she slew her, and retired
into the mountains until her husband was appeased or
had discovered a new lady. The court etiquette of that
period was under the baneful influence of Turkey. Milo&#353;
used to live in Turkish houses&mdash;some of them are extant
to this day&mdash;he gave audience as a Turkish pasha, seated
amid cushions on the floor, his room was hung with captured
Turkish flags, and on his head he wore a turban.
It was often rumoured that when he had gained sufficient
money he would not continue to forbid the working of the
Serbian salt-mines, lest the profits of his own mines in
Roumania should diminish; and it is not creditable that
he should have made his subjects pay their contributions
to the Turkish Tribute in the currency of Austria, while
he would forward it in Turkish currency&mdash;of course less
valuable&mdash;and keep the difference. He also tried to
monopolize the swine trade, the most lucrative in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
country; he seized whatever he coveted&mdash;lands, mills
and houses&mdash;and even burned down a part of Belgrade
in order to build a new Custom-House, whose takings would
flow into his pocket. "Am I not the chief," he said,
"the Gospodar, and shall I not do what I like with my
own?" But he was a real Prince. After the Peace of
Adrianople in 1829 an edict was issued by the Sultan,
which recognized Serbia as an independent principality,
with Milo&#353; as hereditary prince. He organized a standing
army and built roads and schools and churches. He
abolished, in 1833, the old Turkish system of land-tenure
and introduced that peasant proprietorship which causes
the Serbs, down to this day, to go into battle in defence
of their own lands. In 1836 he offered the bishopric
of &#352;abac to the famous Bulgarian monk, Neophyte Rilski,
who wrote the first Bulgarian grammar and translated
the New Testament, of which the first edition was burned
by the Greek Church at Constantinople, while the second
edition sold to the then enormous extent of 30,000 copies.
The modest monk, who was born in 1793 and died in
1881, preferred the life of a student and teacher;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> he
therefore declined an offer which was so creditable to him
who made it.... Yet in spite of Milo&#353;'s great services
to his country he had his detractors. It was one of
them, perhaps, who painted the portrait that one usually
sees of him&mdash;an incongruous portrait, because the uniform
is most correct&mdash;he is holding in his hand the Serbian
military headgear, not a turban&mdash;but the face, with its
serpent-like moustaches, high cheek-bones and black eyes,
looks more like that of a Tartar than anything else. Those
who did not care for Milo&#353; said that it was barbarism not
to let the laws be put in writing; but to this he never
would <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'consent,'">consent.</ins> In 1835 he announced in the official
Gazette (<i>Novine Srpski</i>) that he was the "only master";<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
he set about gaining for his country the interest of
foreign Powers. England, which in 1837 sent Colonel
Hodges as her agent to Belgrade, was for having Serbia
placed under the protection of the Great Powers. Constitutional
England was backing Milo&#353; and his despotism,
while, on the other hand, Russia and Turkey came out,
to their own surprise, as champions of a constitution.
They demanded that the power of Milo&#353; should be limited
by something which they euphemistically called "an
organic regulation." Finally, there was imposed on him
a Senate consisting of members appointed for life, but
when this body asked him to account for the manner
in which he had spent the public funds the Prince found
that he could not allow himself to be so hampered and,
in 1839, he abdicated. ("If," he once said, "if Charles
<small>X.</small> of France had understood how to govern as I myself
did in Serbia, he would never have lost his throne.")
Vut&#269;i&#263;, his arch-enemy, flung a stone after him into the
Save. "You will not return," he cried, "until a stone
can float on these waters!" "I shall die as Serbia's
ruler!" shouted Milo&#353;. (And when he ultimately did
come back Vut&#269;i&#263; was cast into prison, where he died
mysteriously&mdash;Milo&#353; refusing the Turks permission to
examine the body.)</p>


<p class="section">THE SLAV SOUL OF CROATIA</p>

<p>His democracy, in spite of his agrarian reforms, was
very far from that of Vuk, and far from that of a young
noble of Croatia, Ljudevit Gaj, who one evening in the
drawing-room of Count Dra&#353;kovi&#263;&mdash;the same Count
Dra&#353;kovi&#263; who wrote in German, for such was the spirit
of the time, his Exhortation to Croatian Maidens that
they should be truly Croatian&mdash;well, in this gentleman's
house at Zagreb Ljudevit Gaj recites some verses he has
written for a dowager. They are in Slav. The audience
is inclined to be amused. Of course they know something
of the language because, like Anastasius Gr&uuml;n in the
Slovene country, they talk it to the servants. But
among themselves in Croatia the upper classes prefer to
use Latin. There is no doubt, as Count Louis Voinovi&#263;, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Yugoslav poet, has said, that this pursuit of Latin brought
into the Slav world much that is indispensable in modern
thought. It created among them an atmosphere of social
courtesy, which, according to Saint Francis of Assisi, is the
sister of Charity. It has humanized the Slav world and
furnished it thus with formidable weapons. But, on the
other hand, it cast a veil over the differences between the
nations and caused people to be blind to their own national
genius. The Croat nobility, with few exceptions, were
at this time so much in harmony with the Magyar magnates,
so anxious to prevent their peasants from hearing
the Marseillaise, that they would, if need be, learn the
Magyar language. But to use Slav in a drawing-room!
This was a new idea. They smiled good-naturedly; but
Gaj, with some other young men, some priests and some
savants, founded a literary brotherhood that was to become
famous under the name of "Danica." Famous also
is an image he conceived. "The Southern Slavs," said
he, in his programme of 1836, "are as a triangular lyre
whose extremities are at Scutari, Villach and Varna." He
said there was a time when the strings of this lyre resounded
with harmonious sounds, but that the winds in
their fury have torn them. Styria, Carinthia, Carniola,
Croatia, Slavonia, Montenegro, Herzegovina, Serbia,
Bulgaria and Southern Hungary are these broken strings,
which it is necessary to repair. Let the people in these
lands, he said, forget their religious differences and remember
that they are the children of one mother. Let
them write the same language. Gaj thus aimed at bringing
Vuk's reforms to bear upon the Latin characters with
which the Serbo-Croat language is written in Croatia.
Before his party was victorious it had to vanquish most
determined opposition. Pamphlet was hurled against
pamphlet, grammar against grammar, Gaj and his men
had to overcome not only those who were the guardians of
tradition, but all those who thought it natural and proper
that in syntax there should be some difference between
the Croat and the Serb. Yet now the philologists are
out and the poets; their business takes them between the
legs of the Great Powers, where they sometimes come to
grief, but they are striking all those fetters from their
nation. Peter Preradovi&#263; is born in the Military Frontier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and he dies an Austrian General. At the beginning of his
distinguished career he could speak nothing but German,
and it was in emotional German poetry that he first
expressed himself. But afterwards, carried away by the
new winds that were cleansing the Croat language and
sweeping from it the reproach of being a mere jargon for
the servants, he became in his "Putnik" (The Traveller)
and "Braca" (The Brothers) the greatest poet of the
Croats. It is noteworthy that when this Austrian
General writes a drama he takes for his hero the old
legendary hero of the Serbs, Marko Kraljevi&#263;. The Ban
of Croatia, Ivan Mazurani&#263;, is a Latin poet in his youth;
but when this high official too comes under the stirring
influence of Gaj he dedicates himself to his own people and
composes in "The Death of Smail Aga"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> a poem that
among Serbian-speaking people has become so much the
property of all that the poet has been lost in the shadow of
his own work. Peasants who sing fragments of it as they
toil in the fields, and the minstrel, the guslar, who chants it
for them of an evening, believe that it is, like their folk-songs,
the anonymous production of the Serbian people.</p>


<p class="section">THE MAGYARS AND CROATIA'S PORT</p>

<p>With the General and the Ban there is the Bishop,
Joseph George Strossmayer, one of the greatest men of the
nineteenth century. But before he became Bishop of
Djakovo he saw the Government suppress those aspirations
which he laboured for throughout his life. The Austrian
Government had presented Gaj, in recognition of his
literary work, with a diamond ring; but when they saw
that his Illyrian programme persisted in aiming at the
union of Croatia and Dalmatia, then at last they vetoed
his Illyrianism and the word Illyria. His friends thereupon
called themselves the "National party," which was
in the Croatian Diet more numerous than the "Magyarones,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
who&mdash;many of them unprogressive landlords&mdash;stood
for the most absolute union with Hungary. The
National party demanded that Rieka, which was still
"separatum sacr&aelig; regni Hungari&aelig; adnexum corpus,"
should be united with the rest of Croatia; but the
Magyars would naturally not let their one small port be
taken from them. Those among the Magyars who consented
to discuss the matter with the Croats said that
if indeed they had purloined one Croat port (for they
confessed that 350 kilometres separate Rieka from the
nearest place in Hungary), yet the Croatians could afford
to treat them with generosity, since they possessed at least
two other ports, Bakar and Zengg, that were every bit
as good. It was quite true that till Rieka was connected
by the railway to the valleys of the Save, the Drave and
the Danube, she had no advantage over Zengg and
Bakar. None of these are natural ports: at Rieka there
is no protecting island, Zengg and Bakar are available for
small ships only, and behind all three there is a barrier
of mountains. All of them, moreover, suffer from the
visitations of the bora, which blows from the north
sometimes for weeks on end. Having pointed out their
own necessities and all these limitations, the Magyars
stayed at Rieka. But they cast about them for some
means by which the inconvenient Croats could be countered,
and of course the simplest plan was to protect, as
Austria was doing in Dalmatia, that small party of the
Slavs on whom the presence of a few Italians at Rieka
and their knowledge of this language and perhaps their
education at some school in Italy had made such a profound
impression that they wished no longer to be looked
upon as Slavs&mdash;and some of them quite honestly thought
that they were not Slavs. Of such was the Autonomist
party, whose sole purpose was to flourish at Rieka in
alliance with Hungarians and to keep Rieka a free Hungarian
town. Perhaps the Magyars had no choice of
methods, but it does not look magnanimous to plant
yourself in some one else's house and then proceed to make
conspiracies with a disgruntled child. They succoured
the Autonomists in every way. For instance, the Croats
had, as elsewhere on the coast, been so unjustly kept from
having schools. The two or three schools in existence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
were for those who turned their back on national ambitions
and cultivated modern Italian, even as the nobles up at
Zagreb had cultivated Latin. Now in 1838 the Croats
of Rieka, who&mdash;it is needless to say&mdash;were much the more
numerous part of the population, thought that Gaj's
wonderful educational movement, which was spreading
far and wide, should not find Rieka unresponsive. So
they asked that the Croatian language should be taught,
as well as the Italian, in the local schools. "This was the
first attempt," says Mr. Edoardo Susmel,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> who is, I gather,
a schoolmaster or an ex-schoolmaster at Rieka. "But
the people of Rieka," he says, "always with admirable
tenacity resisted the brute force with which the Croats
wanted to impose on the Italian city the rights of him who
is strongest. The city arose as one man against this first
attack and the schools remained Italian."</p>

<p>The conflict in the Croatian Diet between the National
party and that of the Magyarones grew in violence. The
latter, egged on from Buda-Pest, demanded in the most
peremptory fashion that the Croat deputies should henceforward
speak in Magyar instead of Latin. It was in the
same year, 1843, that one of the deputies, Ivan Kukulejevi&#263;,
made the first speech in Croatian. Szemere, a
Magyar, cried out furiously that Croatia was a land which
had been conquered by force of arms, and the Hungarian
Parliament went so far as to pass a law which made the
teaching of Magyar obligatory in Croatian schools and for
the Croatian delegates in the Hungarian Diet. The Croats
replied by petitioning the Emperor to separate their country
completely from Hungary. Ferdinand <small>V.</small> wavered between
the two sides; in 1843 he annulled the decisions of the
Hungarian Parliament, and in 1844 he laid it down that
in six years the Croats would have to adopt Magyar as
their official language. It seemed as if the questions
between Magyar and Croat could be settled by no
other method than by war.</p>


<p class="section">THE SULTAN REIGNS IN BOSNIA</p>

<p>There was not in the other Southern Slav lands much
consolation for the National party. In Bosnia the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Revolution and the Serbian wars of independence had an
unfortunate effect, for in 1831 the Muhammedan Serbs
of that province, under the leadership of Hussein Bey,
the captain of Grada&#269;ac, began a holy war against the
"giaour Sultan," because Mahmud thought it timely to
promulgate a few reforms. Hussein assumed the title
of "The Dragon of Bosnia"; and if it had not been for
several other Moslem potentates who were not only
inimical to the Sultan but to the Dragon and to each
other, it would have taken the Sultan's army more than
five years to assert itself. In 1839 the Sultan's representative
at Gulhane had orders to reform the administration,
and this time the chief of the indignant begs was
Ali Pasha Rizvanbegovi&#263;, a powerful personage in Herzegovina.
The revolt was, after a good deal of bloodshed,
suppressed by Omar Pasha, who was determined to break
once and for all the arrogance of the Bosnian aristocracy.
Hundreds of begs were executed, drowned in the Bosna
or taken in chains to Constantinople. But all these
transactions did nothing to improve the lot of the raia.
They had been roundly told in 1832 by His Apostolic
Majesty that any one of those Christians "who persist in
venturing to raise the banner of revolt" would be sent
back from the Imperial and Royal frontier. After all
there was a courtesy which monarchs must maintain
towards each other.</p>


<p class="section">A SORRY PERIOD FOR THE SOUTHERN SLAVS</p>

<p>When the Croat National party looked at Serbia
they saw a people torn in two by rival dynasties: Michael,
the son of Milo&#353;, had after a few years followed his father
into exile, as he also could not grow accustomed to ruling
with a Constitution. After him came Alexander, son
of the assassinated Kara George. He was a cold, indifferent,
slothful prince, and constantly the banished
house of Obrenovi&#263; was plotting to turn out this scion
of the house of Kara George. But after sixteen years
his people turned him out.... In the Banat the Serbs
were going backward. For example, they were at the
summit of their strength in Arad in the eighteenth century,
and since then they had been unable to resist the German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
wave. Time was when Arad had a Serbian princess, the
wife of blinded Bela; and they were much esteemed when
from 1703-1711 the Serbian cavalry and infantry had
fought so strenuously for Austria against the rebels.
Afterwards the Austrians believed they could get on
without the Serbs; they started to destroy their privileges
and to persuade them to give up their Church&mdash;it was in
consequence of this that many of the Serbs in Arad went
to Russia. A certain Colonel Peter Szejadinac objected
to the Austrian policy and came to Arad for the purpose
of procuring some alleviation for the Serbs, but he was
broken on the wheel. In Teme&#353;var the Serbs had also
basked in glory. Until 1818 they had owned all but
seventeen houses of the inner town; they had their own
magistrature. Until 1860 they remained the wealthiest
community, but here also there was an influx of Germans
against which they could not stand.</p>


<p class="section">SOME WHO TURN FROM POLITICS GROW PROSPEROUS</p>

<p>However, owing to this endless struggle which the
Serbs of Hungary were waging, they developed their
activity and energy. The land was rich, particularly
Ba&#269;ka, and that province held the town of Novi Sad,
which was not only prosperous but the home of learning.
When Serbia was not in a position to devote herself to
intellectual or to literary life, she was assisted always
by the Serbs of Novi Sad. And thus in other parts
of southern Hungary the Serb, by his continual efforts
against other people, such as the industrious German,
made to flower those aptitudes within himself which
under Turkish domination had perforce been lying dormant....
It is no unusual thing in the Banat to find
a Serbian farmer who is five or six times a millionaire in
francs. And if, like a hearty one whom I found having
lunch without a collar, they have no children, then they
are even more anxious to build schools and churches and
to support anything Serbian. This gentleman, who lived
in his native place, had presented it with a very fine school,
and then had gone there himself, to learn how to read and
write.... The Serbs of southern Hungary took a most
active part in the events of 1848. When they saw that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
conflict with the Magyars was inevitable, owing to the
new Hungarian Constitution which created an enormous
and free Hungary, but only free for the Magyars&mdash;a State
founded on a mixture of democratic and feudal principles,
reserving always the chief places for the magnates, lay
and ecclesiastic, while rejecting the idea of universal
suffrage&mdash;then the Serbs of southern Hungary assembled
at Karlovci at the beginning of May and conferred upon
Archbishop Rajacsich the title of Patriarch, at the same
time electing Colonel Stephen &#268;uplikac the voivoda or
chief of the Serbian Voivodina, which was to comprise
Syrmia, Baranja, Ba&#269;ka and a part of the Banat.</p>


<p class="section">BUT THE CROATS STRIVE FOR POLITICAL LIBERTIES</p>

<p>The Croats, whose last traces of independence had
been wiped out by the Magyars, rallied round Colonel
Joseph Jella&#269;i&#263;. In the resounding and statesmanlike
phrases of his proclamation on March 11, Jella&#269;i&#263; had
declared that a grand purpose was before them. "It is
to attain," said he, "the renascence of our people! Alone
I can do nothing, if among the sons of one same mother
there is not peace and understanding and fraternity."</p>

<p>"We are," exclaimed Gaj at a sitting of the Diet&mdash;"we
are one nation! There are no more Serbs nor Croats!"
One has been too apt to consider that the Croats armed
themselves merely in defence of their own wrongs; their
leaders anyhow looked far beyond.</p>

<p>Two days after Jella&#269;i&#263; had uttered these words the
court of Vienna, aghast at the tempest that was blowing
from everywhere, from Prague and Galicia and Hungary,
from Lombardy and Venetia, and from their own easy-going
capital, had destituted Metternich. On the next
morning the Emperor made it known that he would grant
his peoples all the liberties they wanted. He had not
had time to ascertain whether this would gratify the
Magyars. But as one of the Croatian liberties was the
nomination of Jella&#269;i&#263; as their Ban, the Emperor appointed
him; Jella&#269;i&#263; joined hands with the National party and
proceeded to break all the chains that bound Croatia
to Hungary. By his circular of April 19 he instructed
the Croats to respect no other authority but his. Slavonia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Dalmatia, the Military Frontiers and Rieka were, according
to his plan, to be reunited to Croatia.</p>


<p class="section">THE AUSTRIANS, THE MAGYARS AND THE CROATS</p>

<p>The Emperor's plans were far less definite. Between
Croat and Magyar he was unable to make up his mind.
What he wanted most of all was recruits for his Italian
armies, seeing that Radetzky had been forced back by
the insurgents, and Venice, under the presidency of Daniel
Manin, had separated herself from Austria. When the
Hungarians declared themselves willing to help with their
army in putting a stop to the national movement in Italy,
then the grateful Ferdinand bestowed on them a mandate
to put a similar stop to the "Croat separatism"; he also
suspended the Ban and declared him a traitor to the
Fatherland. This did not unduly depress Jella&#269;i&#263;, for
in the month of June he was solemnly installed by the
Patriarch Rajacsich in the cathedral of Zagreb. On this
occasion the Mass was sung in old Slavonic by the Bishop
of Zengg, and on leaving the cathedral another service
was held in the Orthodox Church. "We desire by this
solemn manifestation," said the Croats, "to make it clear
to all the world that the brothers who belong to the
Catholic and to the Orthodox religions have one heart and
one soul."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the citizens of Vienna had revolted, and the
Court, although the Magyars offered their hospitality,
considered it prudent to take shelter at Innsbruck. It
was to that town that the Croats sent in June a deputation
which explained to the Emperor that Croatia had for
centuries and under various dynasties been an autonomous
country, and that the Magyars had not only, by their new
laws, abolished this state of things but had also abolished
the link that joined them to his empire, for they would
henceforward have a personage, the Palatine, at Buda-Pest
wielding executive power at such times as the Emperor
was absent. The Croats showed the Emperor that
he could thus not rule both at Vienna and Buda-Pest
except if he could be in both places simultaneously;
and Ferdinand acknowledged that this was correct and
that the Magyars had their foibles, but that they were on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the point of sending him recruits. "We hoped," said
the Croats, "that in a new world of liberty the Magyars
would recognize the other races as their equals. We have
been disillusioned, as you will be. And in July when
Ferdinand announced, on the advice of Radetzky, that
he would continue the operations in the Italian provinces
until the bitter end, it became necessary for him to
have these recruits. "We are prepared," said Kossuth,
"to send a Hungarian army to Italy&mdash;in principle."
But while they were debating whether this would not
expose them to the Croats, they were called upon to
put down a revolt in the Banat, where the Roumanian
population was quiescent and the Serbs had risen to
assert the rights of the non-Magyar peoples. There the
Serbs advanced victoriously, as did the Austrian troops
in Italy. This caused the Emperor to assume another
tone when he addressed the Magyars. Let them send a
deputation to Vienna, where the Croats would be represented
also; and together they would come to an arrangement
regulating their relations to each other. The
Hungarians were obstinate, chose Kossuth to be their
dictator and thus began the revolution.</p>


<p class="section">THE CROATS, STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM, INCIDENTALLY
HELP AUSTRIA</p>

<p>Jella&#269;i&#263;, on September 11, crossed the Drave with
forty thousand Croats, annexed the territory between the
Drave and the Mur, and advanced without opposition up
to Lake Balaton. His commissary, General Joseph
Brinjevac, occupied Rieka. They were confident that
History would not misjudge them. "We demand," said
Jella&#269;i&#263;, in his declaration of war, "we demand equality
of rights for all the peoples and for all the nationalities
who live under the Hungarian crown." Before he left
Zagreb he transformed the feudal Croatian Diet into
an elective assembly. This new Parliament cancelled
the institution of serfdom and proclaimed that one of their
objects was to have the Habsburg monarchy a federation,
on the model of Switzerland. One would suppose that it
was clear to everyone that Jella&#269;i&#263; was not fighting for
the Habsburgs but for the subjected nationalities, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that if the vacillating Austrians who had outlawed him
on account of his nationalist views later on joined him in
his attacks on the Magyars, this does not show that he
was fighting Austria's battles. "The banner which the
Croats have unfurled," said Cavour in a great parliamentary
speech a month later, "is a Slav banner, and in
no way, as some people suppose, the banner of reaction
and of despotism.... His [Jella&#269;i&#263;'s] chief, if not his
only, aim was the redemption of the Slav nationality."
This page would doubtless be more dignified if, after the
dead lion, it did not refer to Mr. Edoardo Susmel; but
since the autumn of 1918 a large number of people at
Rieka have pinned their faith to Susmel rather than
Cavour&mdash;his book was handed to me in a most impressive
manner by the mayor. Let us see, therefore, what he
says of 1848. "When the Croats," says he, "on account
of national reasons"&mdash;so far we are with him&mdash;"and on
account of their loyalty to Austria, on account of the
desire of Jella&#269;i&#263; and by order of the Emperor attacked
Hungary, which was at that time fighting for freedom,
they also threw themselves upon Rieka.... For the
first and solitary time Rieka fell into the hands of the
Croats. It was, wrote the contemporary Giacich, an
enemy invasion." Mr. Susmel sails merrily ahead, for
he knows that Truth is mighty and that it is said to
prevail; but in order to convince the most captious he
calls on Mr. Giacich to testify. I know nothing about
Mr. Giacich except that he was a contemporary&mdash;and yet
it seems that one ought not to wish that Mr. Susmel
had rather put his faith in Cavour, who was also a contemporary,
since that gentleman was far less capable and
never could have proved that when a Croat army comes
into a Croat town it is engaged upon an enemy invasion.</p>

<p>The Magyars were not to be repressed so easily, and
Ferdinand made promise after promise to the Croats
and the Serbs if they would help to overcome this people.
From Serbia itself came many volunteers to aid their
brothers who were trying to throw off the Magyar yoke;
they came with the connivance of Prince Alexander, in
fact, he sent one of his generals to lead them. And a
great many hasty Kossuth enthusiasts in Western Europe,
knowing only that the Magyars, a chivalrous nation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
had been in arms against the despotic Habsburgs, and
that the Serbs and Croats had a considerable share in
subduing them, could not find invective virulent enough
for this abominable brood of hell, whose one desire it was
to be a tyrant's executioners. They were denounced
as having not the least conception of independence;
for a people of a disposition so abandoned there was not
the faintest hope of any future; and the day would
come when these outrageous little nations would be
wiped away. Had not the noble Kossuth spoken like a
prophet when he asked disdainfully where was Croatia, for
he could not find it on the map?</p>

<p>In December the new Emperor, Francis Joseph, began
to rule his variegated realm with justice. He confirmed
the Serbian Patriarch and Voivoda, who had been chosen
in the previous May, and he bestowed upon the Serbs
of Syrmia and Ba&#269;ka and the Banat a territory of their
own, with their own organization and jurisdiction. Even
a less extensive Serbian authority, namely, the Banat town
of Velika Kikinda, with its ten dependent villages, raised
its own taxes, had its own police and had the power of
life and death. There was, indeed, a cloud which came
across the Serbians' happiness when &#268;uplikac, the Voivoda,
died suddenly. He was at Pan&#269;evo when he received
from the Emperor the gracious edict and a box of cigars.
No sooner had he mounted his horse, lit one of the cigars
and uttered the word "Brother," than he fell down dead.
As for the Croats, the Emperor made Jella&#269;i&#263; governor
of Dalmatia, which signified the union of that province
to Croatia.</p>


<p class="section">HOW MONTENEGRO REFORMED HERSELF</p>

<p>There was a poet on the throne of Montenegro, the
greatest of Yugoslav poets, who now that the civil governor
(to whom had been entrusted certain duties which it had
been thought a bishop should not exercise)&mdash;now that this
official was expelled, reigned over Montenegro as the first
and last real Prince-Bishop. He was a magnificent person,
even for a Montenegrin, since his height was no less than
6 feet 8 inches; and in his determination to establish
order in the principality he had let nothing intervene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
As Russia, after a longish interval, resumed her subsidies
and paid Peter <small>II.</small> an annual allowance of nine thousand
ducats, together with arms, ammunition and wheat, the
Prince-Bishop was relieved of the necessity of taxing his
people. This made it easier for him to build up a strong
central power that would not be dependent on the tribal
chiefs, though it is doubtful if a despotism was more
suitable for Montenegro's economic circumstances than
the patriarchal form of government. Peter surrounded
himself with a senate of twelve members, whose salaries
he paid, a bodyguard of a few dozen and a police force of
several hundred. These men, who lived to execute his
wishes, were the instruments by which he set about
improving Montenegro. The vendetta was to give way
to the law court; there was something to be said, though,
for the people who withstood this innovation, since the
court's decision was the will of Peter. But no arguments
protected anyone who clung to the old-fashioned ways
of the vendetta or of brigandage or theft from being
placed before a file of the Prince-Bishop's men. Tales are
still recited in the primitive, bleak homes of Montenegro
touching the great number of his subjects whom the poet
put to death. But that was not the only penalty, for of
the two European institutions with which he had embellished
his capital one was a prison. The other was a
printing-press, in which he had a childish joy. Once
when he was entertaining King Augustus of Saxony he
composed a poem for him while they were at supper;
it was printed in the night; the happy author, next
morning, not a little proud of this achievement, gave a
copy to the King. He issued an official paper from this
printing-press; its name was <i>Grlica</i>, which means "The
Turtle-Dove."</p>


<p class="section">THE PRINCE-BISHOP GIVES A LEAD TO THE SOUTHERN
SLAVS</p>

<p>Now Peter thought the moment had arrived for
Jella&#269;i&#263; to found at last an independent Yugoslav
dominion. On December 20, 1848, he wrote to him:
"An inscrutable destiny has placed you, O illustrious
Ban, at the head of the Southern Slavs. You have pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>served
their throne, their destiny for the Habsburgs....
A grand mission is yours; from it may arise a new formation
of Europe. Its accomplishment would absolve
the Slavs from the shame of having been the miserable
slaves or the paid creatures of others. As for me, I am
free, at the head, it is true, of a handful of men, despite
the double malediction of tyranny and espionage." [Here
he is referring to his neighbours, Austria and Turkey.]
"But what does that matter when I look round me at
millions of brothers who are in alien bondage? Occupy
Dalmatia immediately and let us join each other. That
which one does not conquer with <i>heroic right</i> is worth
nothing. I am ready to come to your help with my
Montenegrins." To these overtures Jella&#269;i&#263; gave an
evasive reply. It may be that he did not deem the
moment opportune, it may be that, as some have said,
he came under the atavistic influence of the military
traditions of the Croats, whose long years of fighting for
the Habsburgs had made them as devoted to that House
as the Dalmatians had been for so long to Venice. The
Habsburgs had exploited them, but the Croats felt that
they were bound by all the blood which they had shed
and by the military glory they had won in Austria's
service. Had not Tomasi&#263; and Milutinovi&#263; been the
Generals&mdash;both Croats&mdash;who were sent to change
Napoleon's Dalmatia into a province of the Habsburgs?
And the list is endless. Jella&#269;i&#263; was very probably
deceived by Francis Joseph, who kept dangling before
his eyes a vision of a "Greater Croatia." But, by an
irony of history, this hope of union of the Southern Slavs
was for the time flung very much into the background by
the action of the Tzar, who rescued Austria when in 1849
she was again at variance with the Magyars. Kossuth
had been furious at the Constitution promulgated in the
spring of that year, which not only made obsolete most
of Hungary's privileges, but introduced the principle of
equality among the various nationalities. The Hungarians
had been too much accustomed to the classing of
races as first-class people and second-class people. When
they had been reduced&mdash;the Russian methods being
drastic&mdash;and when their thirteen Generals had been
executed at Arad, Francis Joseph thanked the Croats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
"for their ceaseless energy and for their numerous sacrifices
in the interests of the State." But Jella&#269;i&#263; did not
move, and the Prince-Bishop wrote to Count Pozza, a
friend of his at Dubrovnik. "I had hoped for an instant,
my dear Count," he wrote, "but I am now convinced
that Yugoslavism is, for the time being, merely an idle
word. The Yugoslavs are unconscious of their own
strength and sell themselves unconditionally to the
strongest. It is a subject of profound grief for those who
love them and for sensitive souls." Peter <small>II.</small> did not long
survive. He may have wondered sometimes why the
Croats did not call for him instead of Jella&#269;i&#263;, since his
methods of administration had been so successful in the
principality. He may have meditated sometimes on the
Russians, wondering how one nation could be both so
highly meritorious and so bloodthirsty. He died, aged
thirty-nine, a disappointed man. (His <i>Turtle-Dove</i> expired
some time before.) And he was buried, as he
wished, upon a lonely peak of Lov&#269;en, that vast mountain
over Kotor which, until the deed of his great-nephew's
son, his namesake, was impregnable. Peter <small>II.</small> had always
been a man apart&mdash;it was his opinion that his Church
was being choked with formalism and with ceremonial,
and though he was a Bishop he went to church infrequently.
The poet in him was much more attracted
to the Bogomile sect, which taught that God had two
sons, of whom the elder was Satan and the younger
Christ; and when the world was created, the elder, seeing
how lovely it was, separated himself from his Father in
order to rule the world; and afterwards God sent the
younger son to punish him.... Peter had far greater
merits as a poet than as a ruler. In fact, Pushkin is perhaps
the only Slav poet who surpasses him, and his philosophy
is more original than that of Tolstoi. There came to
Montenegro one Ivanovi&#263;, a Russian missionary, whom
Peter appointed to be President of the Senate. Peter
used to live chiefly in Venice, Rome or Naples, only coming
to Montenegro as a guest, and it was during his residence
in Naples that Ivanovi&#263; introduced a number of reforms.
According to the general opinion, Peter was the greatest
Yugoslav that ever lived; as a ruler he was neither good
nor bad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">AUSTRIA POURS OUT A GERMAN FLOOD</p>

<p>Now that the Austrians had escaped from all their
perils, and Napoleon's <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> had removed the danger
of another revolution in France, they took in hand the
burying of the recent Constitution which had given so
much umbrage to the Magyars and to the Croats no vast
pleasure. In its place, in 1851, the policy of Bach, an
absolutist and a German policy, was introduced. The
Croats and the Serbs of southern Hungary were treated
differently, the latter being given not the territory they
had claimed but one much more extensive, so that they
themselves were in a great minority.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The Croats found
themselves, of course, no longer joined to the Dalmatians.
Everywhere a flood of Germans, the "huzzars of Bach,"
was loosened on the population; German was erected to
be the official language. But the Slovenes took advantage
even of the German atmosphere. Their national consciousness,
which Napoleon had awakened after centuries,
was now aroused. They took small interest, as yet,
in politics, but strove to make material progress, principally
in agriculture, partly too in commerce, such as in
the exploitation of their splendid forests. Like the Slavs
of Istria, they had no educated class&mdash;except the clergy&mdash;which
was strong enough and was sufficiently well
organized to lead them. Consequently it was difficult to
make much headway in the towns against the Germans
here and the Italians there. But they were not discouraged;
by means of organizations, political and economic,
they fought this denationalizing effect of the towns.
That they succeeded in arresting the tendency&mdash;for
example at Gorica and Triest&mdash;is even more laudable
in view of the serious educational handicap which for
years they had to face, and which the Austrians continued
to inflict upon them until 1914. The provincial administration
of Carinthia, for instance, was in 1914 maintaining
three Slovene schools and six hundred and twelve
German schools, although the Slovenes formed one-third
of the population. What the Austrians said was that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
German was a world-language and that it was a fad to
want to learn Slovene. Perhaps the Slovenes told them
that Welsh is not a world-language. Anyhow, being not
only a patriotic but a very practical race, they built their
own schools in the villages, with the result that they have
to-day a far smaller proportion of illiterates&mdash;17-1/2 per
cent.&mdash;than either the Croats or the Serbs. It was well
that they were patriotic and practical; they would
otherwise have reaped a bitter harvest. The Slavs of
Istria, Croatia and Dalmatia were in contact with no
German territories and were for that reason left in the
cold shades. The Slovenes, having Germans near them
and among them, had to have a share in what the Germans
were enjoying and they reaped sagaciously. One must
admit that it was practical on Austria's part to favour
the Italian language in Dalmatia, for it was from there
that she supplied herself with functionaries for the provinces
of Lombardy and Venice.</p>


<p class="section">THE CROAT PEASANTS AND THEIR CLERGY</p>

<p>The Croat peasants were in a much worse condition
than the Slovenes, and the nobles who might have assisted
them in building schools had recently been ruined by the
Austrian agrarian policy, for when in 1853 the Austrians
put into execution what the Diet of Croatia had resolved
to do in 1848 and freed the peasants from their serfdom,
the indemnity they gave the landlords was in Austrian
State papers, which the landlords had to take at the
face value, though this was far above what they were
worth. The owners of the so-called <i>latifundia</i>, mostly
German or Hungarian noblemen, lost very little; for
their wide domains were cultivated mostly by hired
labour, not by peasants settled on the land. But these
big landlords were not eager to build schools for peasants.
It is said these should have been provided by the Church.
The Croatian clergy in the villages would stand in a
much better light if they had, irrespective of the higher
clergy, made more vigorous attempts to bring down the
illiteracy figures which to-day are said to be, for Croatia
and Slavonia, 65 per cent. The higher clergy worked,
with very few exceptions, hand in hand with Austria's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Government, which Government was, after the Concordat
of 1855, the close ally of Rome. If it was the Government's
desire to build no schools, the higher clergy for
the most part acquiesced. It surely is a function of a
Government to occupy itself with education and to turn
away from the great landlords who are frightened that
a peasantry more educated will be troublesome. But
those who have to bear a good part of the criticism are
the village clergy; it is human not to criticize them half
so much for what they left undone as for some aspects
of their private life. The usual old stories circulate to the
effect that they refuse to exercise their office till the
peasant who is asking them to baptize or to marry or to
bury some one brings a suitable amount of produce, eggs
or fowls or something else, in lieu of money; but what is a
more serious matter is the question of women. Three-and-twenty
priests in the diocese of Zagreb passed a
resolution a year or two ago that they were in favour of
a married clergy. A Yugoslav bishop told me that most,
if not all, of these gentlemen had anticipated the Papal
consent; but that in his diocese only 3 per cent. of the
clergy lived in sin [hostile critics say he should have
added the word "openly"], whereas in two other Yugoslav
dioceses, which he named, such clergy might amount
to 50 per cent. An examination of this question, which
exists in other countries, would be unprofitable, were it
not that in Croatia, with a Roman Catholic and Orthodox
population living very often side by side, the circumstances
are peculiar. The people do not take up any narrow
attitude towards the Church of which they are not members:
a Roman Catholic will go to an Orthodox and an
Orthodox to a Roman Catholic church if they have none
of their own. They intermarry; and since their sacred
days, such as Christmas, are not celebrated at the same
time the non-celebrating congregation cease to work, out
of sympathy. Even with the alteration of the Orthodox
calendar there will be days which one community will
keep as workless days, so that it may go visiting the
others and congratulating them. But this bland behaviour
of the people is unfortunately not maintained when
they discuss their priests. And in the Lika, where the
population leads a rough, laborious life, they are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
satisfied to have an academical discussion. They hold
that if a man is celibate he is not manly, and scenes have
taken place which Hogarth might refuse to draw.</p>


<p class="section">WHAT THE CZECHS ARE DOING TO-DAY</p>

<p>The twenty-three priests of the Zagreb diocese who
were in favour of a married clergy and of several other
reforms could not stand up against their ecclesiastical
superiors. The movement has made no open progress and
their leader has been constrained to abandon Holy Orders
and become a timber merchant. Nevertheless the idea
of a national Church has not vanished; a good deal
depends for other countries on the degree of success
which attends the newly established national Church in
Czecho-Slovakia. It already possesses over half a million
adherents out of a population of 13 millions. We may
be going to witness the rise of a series of national Churches,
a consummation which&mdash;a Roman Catholic might observe&mdash;will
very likely be no more successful in bringing nearer
the brotherhood of man than the wide-flung Catholic
Church. The enthusiastic nationalism of such new
Churches may, in fact, help to postpone that happy
state of things. In any case, and whatever be the results,
we shall do well not to ignore the beginnings of what may
be a mighty Reformation.</p>

<p>Ever since 1848 the Czech clergy have been anxious
to obtain reforms, not so much in dogma as in discipline.
They assert that it is more in accordance with the democratic
spirit of the age if a priest is selected not by some
magnate but by his prospective parishioners; they desire
to have their mother-tongue employed for the liturgy&mdash;in
this respect they are in advance of most Catholic
countries&mdash;and they wish to allow their priests to marry
or not to marry, as each man prefers. This, one need
hardly say, is the point which, almost to the exclusion
of all others, is taken up by the hostile compatriots of
the new believers. "It is nothing more nor less than
this," said a portly Benedictine abbot to me one day in
Prague, "there are priests who live in concubinage and
they actually want to have it legalized!" But in
Czecho-Slovakia, with her vivid memories of the Hussites<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
in the fifteenth century&mdash;magnificent new monuments to
John Huss decorate the principal towns&mdash;in Czecho-Slovakia
the old r&eacute;gime has not the same power as in
Croatia. At first the new Church was sneered at, being
called a Churchlet, then they called it a sect, and now
they say it may persist for fifty years. While its critics
occupy themselves so largely with the topic of clerical
celibacy, the founders of the Church themselves are
much more interested in other questions. They do not
greatly concern themselves with their priests' apparel,
holding that this need not trouble them more than a
little, since they are striving for something more weighty&mdash;the
freedom of conscience. In this, as they say, they are
carrying on the doctrines of Huss, which were so bloodily
repressed by the dominant party. Under Charles <small>IV.</small> the
Roman Catholic Church possessed about one-third of all
the land in Bohemia, while in Prague alone there were
some three thousand priests. And if the doctrines of
Huss had not sunk deeply into the minds of the Bohemians
this new Church would have found her task very much
more difficult. The first three bishops were ordained
last year by the Serbian Bishop of Ni&#353;. It was at one
time thought that the Orthodox religion would be
adopted, but this was found to be impossible, and after
a year of negotiations it was settled that the Serbian
Church should be regarded as a sister Church.</p>

<p>The significance of Czecho-Slovakia's new Church is
to be found in the national idea. So much is it a thing
of the people and not of the priests that several schoolmasters
have had to be ordained, the clergy being otherwise
too scanty. In June 1919 a delegation from 3000
dissatisfied priests went to Rome. The Pope rejected
what he called their foolish novelties. In January 1920
a secret meeting of 200 priests was held in Prague and
144 of them declared themselves for a new national
Church. But few of them possessed the necessary
resolution, such as was displayed by Dr. Farsky, a very
intelligent and earnest young man who was Professor of
Religion in the University and has now been appointed
the Head of this new Church, as Bishop of Prague and
Patriarch. His opponent, the Roman Catholic Archbishop
of Prague, has the reputation of being one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
cleverest of Czech politicians, and it will be interesting
to see how the position develops. Since the War the
Roman Catholic Church has lost 25 per cent. of its
members&mdash;during the War it was, in the opinion of many,
though perhaps it had no option, very much the servant
of the Habsburgs. And one imagines that the Archbishop
is handicapped by the demands of his party that
the State should unquestionably continue to pay the
yearly interests of the large number of monasteries that
were dissolved more than a century ago by Joseph <small>II.</small>
"All England's troubles," said the Coadjutor-Archbishop
to me, "emanate from the fact that she nowadays pays
nothing to the Church for those monasteries that were
suppressed by Henry <small>VIII.</small>" It is doubtful whether
the Czechs, exulting in their regained liberty, will for
the most part take the side of Rome when the matter
has been fully ventilated and discussed. "We are not
monarchist at all," said the Abbot Zavoral, "we are
true to the Republic, we are democratic. And discussion
is democratic, but," said he, "it should not be unlimited."</p>


<p class="section">STROSSMAYER</p>

<p>To such a degree did the Austrian Government neglect
its duties that, ten years ago, Croatia and Slavonia were
short of at least one thousand school buildings and twelve
hundred teachers. Bishop Strossmayer, coming from a
family<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> which had settled at the sprawling town of Osiek,
in Slavonia, did what he could. His Yugoslav Academy
at Zagreb, the Zagreb University and the Society for
studying the history of the Yugoslavs are but a few of
the national institutions to which he devoted the princely
revenues of Djakovo. From there this most remarkable
man worked for the intellectual advancement of all the
Southern Slavs; he subsidized the brothers Miladinoff
who made the first collection of Bulgarian folk-songs
(and who, on account of this forbidden subject, were both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
subsequently strangled at Constantinople); he paid for
the education of young students no matter from what
Yugoslav country they came; when Ra&#269;ki, the well-known
Croat historian, was persecuted by the Government
and living in misery, Strossmayer begged him to come
to Djakovo, and Ra&#269;ki was his closest friend for many
years; he built a large gallery at Zagreb and filled it with
pictures, sacred and profane, and was as ready to assist
a young artist in Istria as in Macedonia. It may be that
he caused a circular to be read in the Croatian churches
which referred to the Orthodox as "lost sheep," but he
never used a method other than by prayer and the example
of his life to cause them to forsake their fold; to him the
forcible conversions by the Turks were as abhorrent as a
system that was used in Ba&#269;ka, where a whole village
near Sombor was ennobled&mdash;but not those who afterwards
came to live there&mdash;for having joined the Roman Church.
He was himself no blind follower of the Vatican; and when
he went with a very princely retinue&mdash;in part the weakness
of his humble origin&mdash;to Rome in order to explain why
he was unable to subscribe to the dogma of Papal Infallibility,
he ravished his audience with a marvellous
Latin oration, for he spoke many modern languages but
was most thoroughly at home in Latin. Often in conversation
he passed from one language to another, in
search of what would best express his meaning, and
frequently he would have recourse to Latin. He became
reconciled to the dogma and it was due to the hostility
of Magyar potentates that he remained for more than
fifty years the Bishop of Djakovo, was not promoted to
Zagreb nor made a cardinal. His fervent and statesmanlike
views can be seen in his correspondence<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> with Gladstone.
His head, like Gladstone's, caused one not to
notice that the rest of the body was unimpressive; they
had the same brilliance of eye. This man who worked
continuously for the Southern Slavs could not be always
a <i>persona grata</i> to Francis Joseph. Two remarks of the
Emperor's are handed down, but that one may be a
legend which, with the preface that Strossmayer was the
only man to whom the Emperor was ever rude, says that
Francis Joseph accounted for some proceedings of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
bishop, as head of the National party in Croatia, by
telling him that he must have been drunk&mdash;and, overtaken
by remorse, making him an "Excellency" on the
following day. Yet that story is certainly true which
recounts how in 1881 the Emperor at Belovar said to him
that he would sooner be an unimportant German Duke
than Emperor of all the Slavs.</p>


<p class="section">THE TURK IN MONTENEGRO AND MACEDONIA</p>

<p>The Emperor of a great many Southern Slavs, the
Sultan, had in his time been satisfied if he could squeeze
out of the Montenegrins so much tribute as would every
year pay for his slippers. He could send an army now
and then to devastate Cetinje and destroy the monastery
where the people's bishop lived, but in those mountains
a large army ran the risk of being ambushed and a
very large one would be starved. Besides, now that the
European scientists and travellers were beginning to go
up to Montenegro and were, among the few sights of
Cetinje, always shown the shrivelled head of Kara Mahmud
Pasha, who in 1796 had been defeated, it was not
advisable, the Sultan thought, that any other Turkish
head of prominence should have this fate.... In Macedonia
it was very different; the population might have
once been warlike, but had so successfully been governed
that some German travellers of the sixteenth century,
Hans Ternschwamm and Ritter Gerlach, had described
them as a "conquered, down-trodden, imprisoned people"
who did not dare to lift up their heads, a people who
"without intermission must toil for the Turks." And if
three hundred years of this life had not completely tamed
them, the Sultan had every confidence that the Greek
Patriarch would tell the Powers what they knew already,
namely, that the Macedonian Christians only had to pay a
tenth and sometimes only an eleventh part of certain
crops and that in return they were protected by the
Spahi from the ills which every humbler man is heir to,
and that the Powers, who politically said they must respect
the Sultan, must now morally respect him also. But in
1850 the Turkish Government made a change; in place
of the old Spahi there was installed a landlord who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
retained the name of Spahi but who had none of his
predecessor's careless benevolence. The property had
been hired out to him for life and his one object was to get
from it as much as possible. He made demands not only
for a tenth but for a fifth and even a third part, and not
only of the maize and wheat but of every product of the
soil. Cattle, bees, vegetables, fruit&mdash;of all of these he
had to have his share; the peasant often cut his fruit
trees down as he could not afford to pay the various taxes
that were put on them. In the old days the Spahi had an
arrangement with a whole village, and a system so impersonal
was much less onerous than when demands were
made from every household individually. The new sort
of Spahi was not only an evil product of the time, but as
the progress of industry in other countries was supplying
the Turkish market with many new commodities, so in
order to acquire these articles for himself he exacted more
and more tribute from the helpless peasants. Progress
in Macedonia was not merely retarded&mdash;lands which had
been under cultivation were abandoned, and the peasant,
having been despoiled of everything, perhaps having
borrowed money at 9 or 10 per cent., was no longer able
to get his living from the land on which so many generations
of his ancestors had laboured. It was no longer
possible for him to get the mess of maize and miserable
bread, the strips of repulsive-looking flesh that were his
luxury, the medicine for his underfed children who were
moaning on the naked earth of his cabin, and at the
same time to make the necessary contributions to the
landlord or the landlord's agent, whom the villagers had
to furnish with a riding horse, with gun and ammunition,
with furs and with clothing appropriate to his position,
with special gifts whenever he or they were marrying,
and with all the pretty girls on whom his eye had rested.
Therefore the <i>&#269;if&#269;ija</i> would lose the last shadow of
freedom, he would become a serf. His sowing and his
reaping would now be for another, and as it did not profit
him at all to make the land more fruitful, he was content
with any prehistoric implement, with little wooden ploughs
and with a total absence of manure. And yet this pitiable
serf would often be in a position less deplorable than that
of one who had a little freedom left and who was called a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
free man, for the Turk would treat him no worse than the
mule whose continual existence he desires. It does not
seem surprising if these Christians wanted to be liberated
from the Turk and did not greatly mind what uniform
their rescuers would wear.</p>


<p class="section">THE CHEERLESS STATE OF SERBIA</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Serbs of Hungary were saying that
the state of things in Serbia was desperate. It seemed so
to a number of young men who found the coldness of
Prince Alexander and his anxiety to please the Austrians
both very much out of harmony with the new Liberal
ideas of Western Europe. They would have been horrified
to see the plight of Macedonia, which after the Crimean
War became, if possible, still worse, for during it the
Porte took up the first loan; others followed, and in a
surprisingly short time the Turk stood face to face with
bankruptcy, so that in his dealings with the peasant he
became still more extortionate. To be sure the Liberal
young men who were publishing the <i>Omladinac</i> and
all those Southern Slavs who listened to the voices which
in Italy and Germany were craving union and freedom,
all of them saw in their dreams the freedom of the
Southern Slav, but Serbia and Montenegro were the only
portions of his patrimony which had any kind of independence
and the Serbia of Alexander was in a distressing
state. The Prince had managed to stay neutral during
the Crimean War, in spite of the solicitations very vehemently
put by Austria and Russia and the Porte; this
neutral attitude secured for Serbia at the peace the benefit
of having all her rights henceforward guaranteed collectively
by the Great Powers. Yet Alexander was so
anxious not to rouse the animosity of Austria that he
declined to summon the national assembly, the Skup&#353;tina,
in which the people's rising aspirations could be heard.
And, although the family community, the "zadruga,"
was giving way to a more modern way of life&mdash;much to
the misgiving of those persons who believed that strength
lay rather in the union of thirty or forty people, under the
authority of the head of the house, than in a more dispersed
society which would encourage individual initiative&mdash;yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Serbia was still a semi-Turkish and a quite
despotic country, with all the civil service largely filled
by Serbs from Hungary and many of the higher offices
in the possession of the relatives of the Princess, for
Alexander's wife, a lady from the neighbourhood of
Valjevo, was as celebrated for her cleverness as for her
beauty. It is regrettable that she did not prefer to take
in hand the women's legal status, which is still too much
like that of minors. When the princely pair had been
expelled in 1858 and Milo&#353;, to his infinite delight, called
back from Bucharest, his place of exile, there was yet a
great deal for the Omladina enthusiasts to do. Milo&#353;
at the age of seventy-eight was senile; he would sit for
hours outside his old, white Turkish house at &#268;a&#269;ak,
while the passers-by knelt down to kiss his hand; in
church he would become oblivious to his surroundings
and would garrulously talk in a loud voice to friends
around him.</p>


<p class="section">THE SLAV VOICE IN MACEDONIA</p>

<p>Assuredly the Omladina Society had some knowledge of
affairs in Macedonia, for Dimitri Miladinoff, the elder of
the two brothers, had been at Karlovci, where he was
offered the professorship of Greek at the Serbian school.
Miladinoff had been born at Struga in Macedonia and
educated at Jannina, where he noticed that a number of
the names of forests, rivers, villages and ruins sounded
odd in Greek&mdash;they seemed to have much more resemblance
to the language spoken by the Slavs who lived beyond
his home, the Bulgars. This awoke a flame in him. At
Ochrida, where he was presently appointed as a teacher
in the school, he gave his lessons in the customary Greek,
nor did he undervalue the advantages the Macedonian
Slavs could draw, particularly at the stage they were in,
from the study of Greek literature and from the contemplation
of the patriotic virtues of old Greece. But at
the same time he began to give his pupils a Bulgarian
translation of what they were learning; and one day
in 1845 while he was in the middle of a lesson, taught
in that strange manner, on Thucydides, the Russian
arch&aelig;ologist Grigorovi&#263; appeared and in amazement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
cried, "But we are brothers!" It was to him a marvel
that these people's mother-tongue was Slav. Miladinoff
had a project to retain the Greek at college and to introduce
Bulgarian in the elementary schools, but when in
1848 he spoke of this at Ochrida the notables had grown
so hellenized that they considered an allusion to their
Slav origin as most offensive. Far from giving up his
plan, Miladinoff began a pilgrimage through Macedonia,
pretending that his object was to gather funds for the
construction at Constantinople of a Bulgar church.
Everywhere he taught as he had done at Ochrida, and the
elucidation, for example, of Demosthenes enabled him to
plant his patriotic seeds. It was in the course of his
travels that he (and afterwards his younger brother
Constantine) collected the folk-songs that were published
by the generosity of Strossmayer. He stayed for a time
at Sarajevo and at Karlovci, where he was filled with
emulation by the progress which the Serbs had made.
On his return in 1857 to Macedonia the people of the town
of Kuku&#353;&mdash;near the future boundaries of Bulgaria,
Serbia and Greece&mdash;invited him to be headmaster at their
school. He was overjoyed that this town had the courage
to have the Bulgarian language taught, and we have his
reply. The Phanariote Greeks, he says, "will hurl
their anathema against us! The Bulgarian script is
contrary to God! It will not be the first time that they
have proclaimed this! But those days are past!
Already the rays of dawn...." This letter is written
in Greek. "Oh, how I am ashamed," he says, "to
express my sentiments in the Greek language!" But the
literary form of Bulgarian is, as yet, undeveloped. One
year after his arrival at Kuku&#353; the population removed
the Greek books from their cathedral and listened to the
singing of the Mass in Slav by a Bulgarian monk from
Mt. Athos. When he began to recite the Credo in the
ordinary Bulgarian tongue, the congregation fell on their
knees and burst into tears.</p>


<p class="section">THE MACEDONIAN SLAVS ARE UNDIVIDED</p>

<p>Another Macedonian traveller was the highly distinguished
Frenchman, Ami Bou&eacute;. His great book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<i>La Turquie d'Europe</i>, in four volumes of more than 500
pages each, appeared in Paris in 1840, and is a veritable
encyclop&aelig;dia with which no other publication of the same
kind can be compared, either for the largeness of his
scheme, the versatility of his interests or the profound
knowledge of his subject. Well, he found that many
Slavs of Macedonia, whom he calls Bulgars, had their
hopes centred in Milo&#353;, who was then the reigning Serbian
Prince. The difference in their eyes between the two
people was that the Serbs had gained their independence.
It was not as great an independence as the Macedonians
fancied, for in addition to the vexatious remains of Turkish
suzerainty there was the Greek ecclesiastical rule. During
the reigns of Kara George and Milo&#353; the Greeks insisted on
having their language used for the liturgy in all the
Serbian towns, especially in Belgrade; after that period
Greek and Slav were used for half the service each, and
this practice was continued until 1858. Nevertheless for
the unhappy Macedonians Serbia was a land of radiant
liberty. And whether it was going to be a Serb or Bulgar
who would rescue them&mdash;<i>qu'importe</i>? Ami Bou&eacute; noted,
as have many others, that the Macedonian Slav in his
physical characteristics, in his language, in his outlook, in
his native habits and in the expression of his sentiments
is intermediate between the Serbs and Bulgars. And he
says that as between the Serbs and Bulgars he does not
recognize a greater difference than there is between the
Istrians, the Dalmatians and the Croats, which is to say
that there is none.</p>

<p>This point of view was quite familiar to the readers of
the <i>Omladinac</i>. Svetozar Markovi&#263;, a leader of both
Radicals and Socialists in Serbia, was for a federated
Balkan republic. Ljuben Karaveloff wrote articles in
Serbian, whose object was to show that, in the liberation
of the Southern Slavs, Serbia must take the lead. Rakovski,
the most active of Bulgarian Radicals, maintained
that, in default of union between the Southern Slavs, a
selfish interference of the Great Powers in the Balkans and
unceasing wars among the natives would be unavoidable.
The ideas of Bogdanov regarding the Bulgarian and
Serbian languages were current. "It is not a tower of
Babel," says he, "but a temple of God. When we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
united there will be no curse yelled in a hundred voices
but a harmonious prayer." And in another passage
he declares that "there is less difference, for example,
between Serbian and Bulgarian than between certain
Italian dialects."</p>


<p class="section">DAWN OF ITALIAN UNITY</p>

<p>While they were speaking Italy had acted. It is more
true to say that some Italians had acted. The defence of
Venice and the five days at Milan are glorious episodes, but
those volunteers who flocked to Garibaldi, notably from
Piedmont, and of whose exploits we can never hear enough&mdash;in
what proportion were they to the inhabitants of the
Peninsula? The people as a whole exhibited indifference,
which causes Garibaldi to complain most bitterly. And if
it had not been for the genius of Cavour and his collaborators,
for the diplomatic support of England, the alliance
with Prussia and, above all, for the French army, the
redemption of the country would have been delayed. No
doubt the Church had an enormous influence upon the
people, no doubt in the surviving medi&aelig;val States&mdash;the
duchies and republics&mdash;whose government belonged to
the privileged classes, there was little to awaken popular
interest; no doubt great masses of the people were
untouched by education and the spread of new ideas&mdash;if
freedom is a new idea; no doubt the peasants in various
parts of the country were in as deplorable a plight as the
peasants of to-day, which has had as one effect the inexpansive
manner, as Italian officers have testified, with
which the redeemed peasants of the Trentino and elsewhere
often welcomed their redeemers. And the Italian peasants
of 1859 may be pardoned for imagining that this world
never would be made so good as to include their own
salvation. One can find sufficient excuses for what occurred
in Italy. Will not the Italians excuse, rather than
praise, the very, very small number of Yugoslavs who
have stood out against Yugoslavia? When Italy had
been united did no Italians choose rather to go into
exile?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">HOW CAVOUR WOULD HAVE TREATED THE SLAVS</p>

<p>Some Italians were so intoxicated with the success of
Garibaldi's troops and the French army that they began
to see dangerous visions. Once again, on December 28,
1860, they were warned by the great founder of their
country. "Let us avoid," wrote Cavour,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> "every
expression which could permit one to suppose that the
King's government aspires not merely to the possession
of Venice, but also to that of Triest, with Istria and
Dalmatia. I know well that in the towns of the littoral
the population is fundamentally Italian by race and sentiments,
but that the rest of the country belongs exclusively
to the Slavs.... Every word which touches
this question, however lightly it be uttered, would become
a dangerous weapon in the hands of our enemies. They
would know very well how to use them in order to raise up
England against us, for that Power would also not look
with favour on the Adriatic Sea becoming, as in the days
of Venice, an Italian Sea." Cavour's opinion as to the
towns was presumably based on such researches as were
made in 1842 by Kandler. The city of Triest contained in
that year 53,000 persons "who speak Italian" and
21,000 "who speak Slav"; but as Italian, an international
language, was used by the numerous German, Armenian,
Greek, Turkish and Levantine colonies, and was spoken
in public by all the Slavs, the 53,000 would lose a considerable
proportion who were not fundamentally Italian by
race or sentiments. It may safely be stated, on the
other hand, that none of the Italians and an infinitely
small number of the exotic population would speak Slav,
so that one may say that Triest contained 21,000 Slovenes.
One need not attach overmuch importance to the fact
that the town in 1866, among other manifestations of
loyalty occasioned by the defeat of the Italian navy near
Vis (Lissa), created the Austrian Admiral Tegetthoff an
honorary citizen. Even if the 53,000 had all been
Italians, Triest might have thought it expedient to act
in this way.... Cavour may have accepted in very good
faith the similar figures for the little ports of western
Istria; in them there was no such miscellaneous population,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
but a large number of those who spoke Italian did so
because it was only at this period that the Bishop, Dr.
George Dobrila, the great regenerator of the Istrian Yugoslavs,
began to rouse his countrymen and to induce them
not to discard their own language. "Wachen sie die
Slaven" ("Awaken the Slavs"), said Francis Joseph
before the war against Italy in 1866 when he was anxious
for the southern provinces; and although the Emperor
used various means to put the Slavs to sleep again, it may
be noted that in 1861 Cavour would learn that in the Diet
there were two Slavs against twenty-eight Italians, in the
Parliament no single Slav; whereas if he had lived another
fifty years he would have seen the same country returning
nineteen Slav deputies to the Diet against twenty-five
Italians, and three to the Parliament at Vienna against
three Italians....</p>


<p class="section">ITALIAN <i>v.</i> SLAV: TOMMASEO'S ADVICE</p>

<p>As for Dalmatia, where also the Italian-speaking
population was not fundamentally Italian by race or
sentiments, we may turn to the renowned Nicolo Tommaseo,
whose authority the Italians do not dispute. "We
must not abolish the Italian language," he said&mdash;and this
was in the year 1861&mdash;"for it would be a dream of fools
to wish or hope to be able to abolish it immediately in
public life without causing offence and confusion and injury
even for those who speak Illyrian; this would be a
tyranny the more abominable as it would be powerless ... because
the Illyrian tongue, as is the case more or less with
all the Slav languages, spoken by nations which up to the
present have not entirely participated in the abstractions
of science and in the refinements of European art, is not
as yet equipped with all that reserve of terms and locutions
which is demanded in a highly developed social life,
<i>although that language possess in itself all the elements</i>."
This capacity which he recognized in the Slav languages
and which came subsequently to the surface in Russian
and Czech literature, would, he said, in two generations
cause the Slav to be employed as the official language of
Dalmatia. He stipulated for two generations "because,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in the first place, it is necessary that this language should
be learned regularly in the schools from the lowest to the
highest class, without for that reason ever banishing
Italian; and secondly, it is requisite that men should
become skilful in the use of this language and should
render it adequate for the needs of social life."</p>


<p class="section">AUSTRIA LEANS ON GERMANS AND ITALIANISTS</p>

<p>For a moment after her Italian misfortunes Austria
assumed a kindly mien towards her Slavs. In the manifesto
of July 15, 1859, which made public the treaty of
peace, the Emperor promised "immediate modifications
in the laws and in the administration." Bach, the German
reactionary, was succeeded by <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Goluchovski'">Goluchowski</ins>, and in April
1861 Ivan Mazurani&#263; became the Croat Chancellor at
Vienna, with educational, legal and religious affairs included
in the sphere of his office. The incorporation with
Dalmatia was not granted then, but was promised. A
letter was, however, sent to Mamula, the governor of
Dalmatia, ordering him to create a majority hostile to the
Emperor's letter of December 5, 1860, in which he had
invited the two provinces to send their delegate to a
conference at which the union would be discussed. The
shrill protests of the German party were successful; for
the next few years the Slavs were being pushed into their
pit and then helped half-way out again. Schmerling, the
German, would evolve an electoral system by which the
Parliament must always have a German majority;
Francis Deak, the Hungarian, would make excellent
proposals that too often suffered shipwreck through no
fault of his, he would manage to pass liberal legislation
which remained in after years upon the statute book and
was exhibited by Magyars to appreciative foreigners.
The general tendency of those years after the Italian
disaster was unfavourable to the Slav. In southern
Hungary the Serbian duchy was dissolved, despite their
protests, after an existence of eleven years. But as
Francis Joseph was no longer able to bestow caresses on
the recreant Italians he transferred his love to the Dalmatian
autonomists, who now began to call themselves the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Italian party. It is probable that he smiled on these
2&frac12; per cent. of the province, not only because of his family
traditions, his leaning towards Italian art and the hope
against hope that he would once more some day rule in
Italy, where he had his numerous well-wishers among the
clergy and the rural population&mdash;it is possible that he was
gracious to the autonomist Dalmatian party because they
were a brake upon the national sentiments. Until 1866
the whole administration was conducted in the language
of the 2&frac12; per cent. In that year the Ministers of Justice
and of the Interior decided to ask officials who thenceforward
entered the Dalmatian service to have some sort
of knowledge of the Illyrian language. In 1869 these
Ministers permitted the Dalmatian communities to correspond
in their own language with the tribunals and the
administrative authorities; while in 1887 the administrative
authorities and the tribunals were ordered to reply
in Serbo-Croat to the local bodies who used that language.
The autonomist party may not appeal to us and apparently
it did not appeal to Nicolo Tommaseo. From wherever
he is he must be looking on with interest at a controversy
between two Italian writers who both published books on
Dalmatia in 1915 and who bear witness&mdash;Mr. Cippico to
the truth that Tommaseo was an autonomist and Mr.
Prezzolini to the truth that he was not. "The theory of
Tommaseo," says Mr. Cippico, "desires an autonomous
Dalmatia between the mountains and the sea." "Go
to!" says Mr. Prezzolini. "Have the kindness to read
what the man writes. Here is a passage: 'Whatever
one may say about it, it will not be Croatia, a poor country,
lacking in civilization, <i>but the opulent Slav provinces subject
to Turkey</i> and morally less in subjection than Croatia,
which, when they and Dalmatia are united, will make
her wealthy and the mother of civilization and wealth.
Destiny therefore lays it down that Dalmatia in the days
to come shall be the friend and not the subject of Italy.'
Tommaseo showed in 1848 what he thought of such a
subjection. 'In 1848,' he writes, 'I could have raised
the whole of Dalmatia with the help of an Italian colonel
who with his men had offered to dislodge the German
governor of Zadar, but I refused; I refused, because I
foresaw.' And just as he was opposed to the union with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Italy, so likewise was he opposed to autonomy. You
spoke of mountains and the sea. Permit me to direct your
attention to some lines of his:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'N&egrave; pi&ugrave; tre il monte e il mar, povero lembo<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Di terra e poche iznude isole sparte,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">O Patria mia, sarai; ma la rinata<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Serbia (guerniera mano e mite spirto)<br /></span>
<span class="i5">E quanti campi, all' italo sorriso<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Nati, impaluda l'ottoman letargo,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Teco una vita ed un voler faranno....'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This one would translate as follows: 'Thou shalt no
longer be, O my country, a poor stretch of land between the
mountains and the sea, with some bare scattered islands;
but Serbia reborn, that is now sicklied o'er with Turkish
lethargy, shall make one life and one desire with thee and
with all these fields that sprung into being under an
Italian smile.' If you really think that this proves that
Tommaseo contemplated a harmonious coexistence in
Dalmatia of the two countries, Serbia and Italy, then I
beg you to read the passage once again." This Mr.
Antonio Cippico, by the way, is a native of Dalmatia with
most Italian sympathies; another Cippico from Dalmatia,
a cousin of his, has for years been a well-known litt&eacute;rateur
in Belgrade, and according to him the great majority of
the Cippico family are of his way of thinking.</p>


<p class="section">THE SOUTHERN SLAV HOPES ARE CENTRED ON CETINJE</p>

<p>While Tommaseo foresaw this union, his contemporaries
of the Omladina strove for another one. Prince
Michael Obrenovi&#263; had, in 1860, again succeeded his
father, and as it was not known if he had undergone a
change in exile, the young patriots of the Omladina
did not look upon him as the saviour of the Serbian people.
There was again a poet on the throne of Montenegro, a
youth of whom they heard romantic things. Not only
had Prince Nicholas borne arms against the Turk, but he
had sung in moving verse the glory of the Serbian heritage,
the triumphant union of the Serbs that was to be. Since
1860 he had guided Montenegro's destinies&mdash;his uncle,
the first purely temporal ruler, Danilo, having been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
assassinated in the Bocche di Cattaro after a reign of warfare
against the Turk, and his own subjects, who resented
the deposition of the tribal chiefs, the imposition of
terrific taxes, based on the number of cattle they possessed,
and occasional seduction of their wives. The
Omladina knew that Michael had been visiting the
West, that he had frequented the masters of science and
politics in London, Paris and Berlin; but he would probably
forget their precepts and in any case he was much
duller than the splendid youth whom they affectionately
called Nikita.... Some historians have wondered why
this young man did not alienate the affection of his people
by the slaughter of the Kadi&#263; clan, whereof a member had
assassinated Prince Danilo. But it was the Senate which
punished the murderer by exiling him, with seven families
of his kindred, to Turkey. Danilo had been aware of his
intention, while the man was waiting&mdash;in obedience to
Austria's orders&mdash;at Kotor. And the Prince, acting on a
local custom, sent word that if Kadi&#263; did not return to
Montenegro he would bestow Mrs. Kadi&#263; on some one else.
After two weeks she became the wife of a neighbour.
The story that Kadi&#263; was avenging her seduction is an
Austrian invention, for Danilo seems never to have met her.</p>

<p>One day in 1862 the Turks, who still were in the
Belgrade fortress, started, for some foolish reason, to
bombard the town. Prince Michael in the subsequent
negotiations showed that he had qualities one could not
but respect. Still he was unsuccessful (until 1867) in
obtaining the removal of the Turkish garrisons&mdash;Great
Britain, fearing Russian influence, and Austria, hostile
to the total independence of the Serbs, supported Turkey.
And Michael governed with so firm a hand that there
were many who believed that the material improvement
he was introducing, schools of agriculture, schools of
forestry and what not, could be just as well inaugurated
by the far more sympathetic Prince Nikita. And when
in 1866 Michael and Nikita made a grand convention
for the union of the Serbs in Serbia and in Montenegro,
and Nikita undertook to step aside, if necessary, so that
all the independent Serbs might be united under Michael's
sceptre, then indeed the Omladina talked of him with
rapture. And Nikita made allusions to this "grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
refusal" all his life and with a face of honest pride. He
never mentioned anything about clause 3, which was not
published. By that clause Nikita was to be Prince
Michael's heir, in case he had no son. There was not
much likelihood that he would have one, for the Hungarian
wife from whom he was divorced<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> had given him no
children, and the girl with whom he was overpoweringly
in love was a cousin, whom the Church, because of their
relationship, prevented him from marrying. It was with
this girl that the Prince was always said to have been
walking in the park near Belgrade on June 10, 1868,
when he was mysteriously murdered.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> After Michael's
death the Skup&#353;tina, not acting in accordance with the
secret clause, placed on the throne a grandson (?) of a
brother of Prince Milo&#353;, who was a minor and the nearest
in the order of succession. By this time the <i>Omladina</i>
had perceived that in the character of their romantic
prince lay certain lamentable traits. The friendship,
which he had inherited, with Russia he continued, and
the Russian Court rewarded him in no half-hearted
fashion. When the Italians proposed in 1866 that he
and they should share the Bocche di Cattaro, he said
the moment was not opportune; the Austrians for this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>bestowed on him a pension which they paid until the
outbreak of the World War. One could understand, of
course, that Nikita did not wish to rouse the enmity of
Austria; it must have hurt him to refrain from going to
the Bocche, where the population was most Slav and
had endured a great deal for the cause, but other men
were hurt by his acceptance of the pension.</p>


<p class="section">FOR THEY KNOW NEITHER NICHOLAS OF MONTENEGRO
NOR MICHAEL OF SERBIA</p>

<p>Michael in those few years had displayed such qualities
that he might have united with his country Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Bulgaria and Macedonia. His statesmanship,
which made such a result seem very possible, may
have induced some jealous partisans of the rival Karageorgevi&#263;
dynasty to murder him; the same reasons
would have been sufficient for Austria. And Austria
had given her formal consent to a diplomatic plan for the
solution of the Bosnian question, whereby Michael was
to administer the two distracted provinces as the Sultan's
mandatory. The decapitation of the begs by Omar
Pasha had by no means marked the dawn of a new era
for the peasant. From 1856 till 1859 the country was
in a condition of such anarchy, with pashas tyrannizing
here and there, with villages obliged to take as their
protector some marauding ruffian who had settled in
their midst, with young men taking to the hills, that finally
a conference was summoned, at Austria's instigation, in
Constantinople, and of this the upshot was that the
abuses practised hitherto by the great landlords were all
sanctioned if they would inaugurate no new ones. The
Franciscan monks, beloved by the people, had kept alive
the people's hope that something would be done for them;
they could not stop the people from attempting to obtain
it by ill-organized revolts. From time to time there
would be a concerted movement; thus Luka Vukalovi&#263;
in 1862 fired his own Herzegovina and also the Bocche
di Cattaro, weapons and volunteers came from Montenegro,
and Vukalovi&#263; was recognized by Turkey as the
military and civil head of an autonomous Herzegovina.
But he was subsequently forced to fly to Serbia, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the Turks had such success against the Montenegrins
that the Great Powers had to intervene. And that was
one of the most fruitful of the insurrections. When the
news was spread that Michael would arrive there were
great popular rejoicings. Christians and Muhammedans
were busy, till the time of his assassination, preparing
for his solemn entry.</p>


<p class="section">IF MICHAEL HAD LIVED!</p>

<p>Many of the Bulgars were as eager to associate themselves
with Michael. In 1862, when Belgrade was bombarded
by the Turks, Rakovski got together a Bulgarian
legion which would fight in Serbia against the common
foe; in 1867 the Bulgarian Revolutionary Committee
at Bucharest, where these leaders of the people had sought
sanctuary, proposed the union of Bulgaria and Serbia
under Michael. "Between the Serbs and the Bulgars,"
says the first article, "there shall be established a
fraternal union calling itself the Yugoslav Kingdom."
If this idea had been put forward by any one but Rakovski
one might consider it a mere fantastic notion, but the
Bulgars who elected this extraordinary man to be their
chief were, as is the habit of the Bulgars, nothing if not
practical.</p>


<p class="section">THE STRANGE CAREER OF RAKOVSKI</p>

<p>Rakovski was born at the picturesque little town of
Kotel in the eastern Balkans, and was educated at Constantinople,
but his ebullient temperament did not allow
him to pursue his studies to the end. He turned up at
Braila in 1841 and, being hardly twenty years of age, was
dreaming of a revolution of the Orient. With a group of
insurgents he tried to cross the Danube and to rouse the
Bulgars. A Roumanian patrol opens fire, on each side
there are several killed and wounded. He is captured
and condemned to death, but having a Greek passport
he is rescued by the Greek Consul and put on board a
boat which lands him at Marseilles. For eighteen months
he lives in France&mdash;it is not known where&mdash;and is imbued
with democratic doctrine. Passing through Constantinople<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
in 1843 he accepts a post as schoolmaster at Trnovo,
but is immediately at loggerheads with the Greek bishop
and departs. Returning to his birthplace he is irritated
by the pride and harshness of the upper class, and he
attempts to make the people rise against them. They
charge him with being a disturber of the peace. "He
has travelled through Europe," says their complaint to
the Government, "and now in this town he bestrides a
horse, brandishes his sword and overwhelms the Turks
with insults, both their race and their religion." In
consequence Rakovski and his father are arrested and
dispatched to Constantinople, where they both of them
remain in prison until 1847. After being liberated, he
forms a secret society which is to take advantage of the
approaching Russo-Turkish conflict. Its members are
to have themselves enrolled among the Turks, with the
double object of protecting the Bulgarian population from
excesses on the part of the soldiery and also, at the propitious
moment, to stir them up and so assist the Russians.
He himself is appointed to the Turkish staff at Shumen,
as first dragoman. His plot being discovered, he is
arrested and sent to Constantinople; on the way he escapes,
but he proceeds to Constantinople and organizes there
a company of heiduks. Turkey's entrance into the
European concert fills him with pessimism. The Bulgars
at Constantinople believe that the civilizing influence of
the West will not be in vain. He foresees a more evil
despotism masked by the pseudo-liberal man&oelig;uvres of
the Powers, and henceforward he joins those Bulgars
who agitate from Roumania or from Serbia. He goes to
the Banat, where he is not only made most welcome but
is enabled to publish <i>The Bulgarian News</i>, which is political,
and a literary supplement, <i>The Swan of the Danube</i>.
The Turks are uneasy; they ask the Austrians to suppress
these papers. The Austrians comply and expel the
editor. He is persecuted by the Porte in Moldavia and
flies to Russia, where he devotes himself seriously to a
long poem in honour of the heiduks. The first part of
this very long work, the <i>Gorski Patnik</i>, had appeared at
Novi Sad. It brought him considerable fame&mdash;he was
compared with Virgil&mdash;but modern readers find this
poem tedious. He likewise wrote a dissertation which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
established, by comparative philology, that the Bulgars
are the most direct descendants of the Aryans, that their
language is the nearest to Sanskrit, and that the other
European languages, including Greek and Latin, are
derived from it. Rakovski next appears in Belgrade,
where he leads a life of splendour; he had carriages and
wonderful horses, he was arrayed in a princely kind of
uniform and was surrounded by a kind of guard. The
source of his revenues, which always seemed to fluctuate,
was never fathomed; but they may at this period have
accrued from his literary labours, which&mdash;although the
present generation smile&mdash;produced among the Bulgars
a vast, patriotic pride. At Belgrade the visionary
historian and whimsical philologist becomes a most
sagacious politician. He is the first Bulgarian publicist
to talk of a free press, and he refuses, unlike many others,
to seek help from Russia only. "We must help ourselves,"
he cries. "As we are Orthodox, Russia will desire to keep
us under the authority of the Greek Church; as we are
Slavs, she will try to make the Western Powers suspicious
of us." When there was a wave of emigration to Russia
he frantically tried to stop it. "For you it will be
suicide," he exclaimed, "for your children assassination
and for Bulgaria ruin!" He painted Russia in appalling
colours, and the would-be emigrants repented. His personal
affairs oppressed him for a time in 1862, when he
left Belgrade to the imprecations of his creditors. The
Serbian statesmen, while appreciating his exalted patriotism,
would have sooner had amongst them a more typical
and stable Bulgar. Yet they declined the Porte's request
for extradition. At the beginning of 1863 Rakovski is
in Athens, magnificent once more and now accompanied
by an aide-de-camp, a Montenegrin captain, whom he
introduces as related to Nikita. He is forming an alliance
of the Balkan States, which, according to his calculations,
will exterminate the Turk in Europe. He promises
himself to furnish 20,000 volunteers&mdash;to start with. In
the previous year when he had planned to liberate Bulgaria
with 12,000 volunteers, of whom a hundred were to
be cavalry and another hundred gunners, he could gather
only 500. And now again he is disillusioned and leaves
Athens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>It was during his stay there that he met the well-known
Balkan travellers, Miss Irby and Miss Muir
Mackenzie. They had been up and down the Peninsula
in 1862 and 1863, making very exhaustive inquiries that
were the basis of their book.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In 1917 Professor Ivan
Shishmanoff discovered two letters of Miss Muir Mackenzie's
in Sofia and published them in <i>Sbornik</i>. The
first is dated May 12, and is in German. "Since we
have been here we have made the acquaintance of Mr.
Rakovski," she writes. "He has been so kind as to teach
me Serbian, during Miss Irby's illness. We like him very
much, and I know of no one among the Slavs with whose
opinion we so entirely agree; because he does not think
as a Serbian or yet a Montenegrin or a Croat or a Bulgar,
but as a Slav.... I can't tell you how much I fear that
their internal divisions will make impossible the realization
of a Yugoslav country. One can't hope for much
from the Greeks; they have exorbitant ambitions and
neither private nor public integrity. Those are bad faults
to find in an ally. And they speak openly of a Byzantine
Empire! And reckon that all the Southern Slavs, Serbs
as well as Bulgars, belong to them.... I hope that
England will some day assure herself that there are other
Christians in the East besides the Greeks."</p>


<p class="section">THE YUGOSLAV NAME</p>

<p>Miss Muir Mackenzie's other letter, of June 23, is
addressed to Rakovski from Bolsover Castle, Chesterfield.
It is written in French. "We attach great importance,"
she says, "to the name Yugoslav. By means of crying
that word in the ears of the Greeks one will succeed in
making them understand that the Bulgars are Slavs.
By means of crying it in the ears of the European diplomats
one will succeed by making them comprehend that
one cannot ignore a people of ten or twelve million souls.
By means of crying 'We are Yugoslavs,' the Yugoslavs
themselves will succeed in forgetting their little distinctions
of environment and race, and in conducting themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
as a nation worthy of the name. Let us therefore
cry that word&mdash;we will make people speak of it sooner or
later."</p>

<p>In June 1863 Rakovski was at Cetinje, but as he was
requesting subsidies he did not find a very sympathetic
audience in Nikita. Thence he passed to Bucharest,
where he issued&mdash;for ten numbers&mdash;a Bulgaro-Roumanian
newspaper; the Bulgars in Bucharest had grown too
prosperous to be interested either in his journalistic or
his military schemes, and he found the Bulgarian colonies
in Russia equally obtuse. He was attacked by consumption
while he was at work upon the <i>Provisional Law for
the National Bands in the Forests</i>&mdash;a sort of written constitution
for the heiduks, and in the intervals of his last
sufferings he wrote a history of the heiduks from the days
of the Turkish conquest. He died on October 20, 1867.</p>

<p>The statesmen who then governed the Great Powers
may have deprecated Rakovski as much as he deprecated
them. It must have been exasperating for those solid
persons subsequently to acknowledge&mdash;if they did so&mdash;that
this unbalanced agitator weighed them very well.
But the Balkan countries were too weak; they had to
suffer being thrown aside, pushed here and there, and
trampled on; for when the Great Powers came down to
the Balkans they could really not pay much attention to
the little peoples of the country and at the same time
keep their eyes upon each other. Afterwards the Balkan
countries found that it was better for them when the
Great Powers fought each other there than when they
came to friendly understandings. It was profitable
and diverting for Albania when the Austrians and the
Italians glowered at each other in that silent land: it
was terrible in 1878 for Bosnia and Herzegovina when the
Great Powers were on such good terms with one another
that they allowed one of themselves to make off with
those two waifs of whom he was not even the wicked
uncle.</p>

<p>Russia had been taking a keen interest in the Balkans
after Austria's disaster in 1859 at Sadowa. It was then
that Prince Gortchakoff and his colleagues in the Ministry
were inspired by the doctrines of Katkoff, who in his
<i>Moscow Gazette</i> exercised much authority over public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
opinion and even over the Tzar. Panslavism, according
to Debidour,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> which a short time ago had been shivering
in the background, lifted its head proudly and spoke of
the new era which holy Russia was about to inaugurate,
of the sacred mission that was incumbent on the Tzar.
And the sanctity was greater in that it was not to be
defined by merely medi&aelig;val but by modern language;
the Tzar must not alone protect all those who practised
his religion, he must be a patron saint who patronizes.</p>


<p class="section">RUSSIA AND AUSTRIA SOW DISCORD IN THE BALKANS</p>

<p>To this end committees, in Moscow and in Petrograd,
deliberated; newspapers and pamphlets spread their
views; agile agents propagated them throughout the
Balkans, calling on the Bulgars and the Bosniaks to rise,
promising aggrandizements to Serbia and Montenegro,
spurring on the fiery Cretans to make their revolt of 1866.
All promised well. There was to be a Balkan federation
formed at the expense of Austria and the Porte: Serbia
would receive the Voivodina and Bosnia, Montenegro
would acquire Herzegovina, the Croats would at least
annex Dalmatia, and the Slovenes and the Bulgars would
come naturally into this united Yugoslavia, under
Michael's sceptre. He was at the time not only in most
cordial relations with the Bulgars, but in 1867 he began
<i>pourparlers</i> to ally himself with Greece, and he made
overtures to the new sovereign of Roumania, Charles of
Hohenzollern. And after this plan also had been nullified
by Michael's death, the Russians still continued with their
task, but now they had to deal with a convalescent
Austria. It came to pass that the Bulgars found themselves
in Russia's sphere, the Serbs in that of Austria.
The little countries were thus violently pulled apart,
and naturally each of them began to stretch their hands
out to the neighbouring Slavs who were in servitude, but
yet they managed to keep hand in hand with one another.
The young men, such as Karaveloff and Tzankoff, whom
Prince Michael sent to Western Europe to be educated,
the young Bulgarian priests who had studied in that
branch of the Belgrade seminary which Prince Michael<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
opened for them, and all the Serbs and Bulgars who considered
their two countries knew that, for political and
economic reasons, they must not be kept apart. But
there was always a Great Power to frustrate these designs.
Yet even after they had been flung at each other in the
fratricidal days of 1885, even after their attempt in 1905
to found a Customs union had been vetoed, even after
some of their so-called <i>intelligentsia</i> had done what injury
they could by harping on the limitations from which
they naturally, like the older peoples, are not exempt&mdash;nevertheless,
as it was seen in 1912, when the demonstrations
of delight in Belgrade and in Sofia were touching,
they are only too glad to fulfil their destiny. Since
1912 that misguided <i>intelligentsia</i> has been given a
large store of fresh ammunition. They will go on firing
and firing, while the people, including the real <i>intelligentsia</i>,
will be better engaged.</p>


<p class="section">THE MACEDONIAN SLAVS UNDER THEIR GREEK CLERGY</p>

<p>The name of Tzankoff brings to mind a strange
ecclesiastical movement. The reader may remember
how the little Macedonian town of Kuku&#353; carried from its
church the books in Greek and how it welcomed the
Bulgarian monk who sang the Mass in Slav. The bishops
and the clergy of the Greek Church had not made themselves
beloved in Macedonia, where the population was
indisputably much more Slav. Greek villages were very
scarce to the north of Lake Castoria; but after the
suppression of the two Slav Patriarchates in the eighteenth
century the only Christians who lead a dignified existence
were the Greek clergy. Among the Slav upper class
there was a good deal of Hellenization; to be a Greek
was of much social value. But the people generally
stayed intact, because the schools so thoughtfully provided
by the Greeks were solely for the boys. The
language spoken in the home would therefore still be
Slav. And it is not likely that the people would have
cherished their Greek clergy, even if they had been
archangels, when once the national awakening had begun.
But what we hear about this clergy is too seldom of a
pleasing character. The children of the Macedonian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
peasants might go into ecstasies on seeing one of these
episcopal processions, with the bishop's glorious white
horse and harness such as they had never dreamed of,
with his footmen round about him and with all those other
priests, the old ones and the young ones and the monks,
and then the bishop's doctor and some other men in
spectacles, and then the bishop's cook and a few more
monks. But the Macedonian villagers who had to entertain
all this rapacious brood and pay terrific fees for everything&mdash;250
piastres for a liturgy, 500 for a whole service,
500 for marriages among relatives up to the seventh
degree, large contributions under the name of charity,
and so forth&mdash;these had only rancour for the Church.
Perhaps the saintliest among the Greeks declined to go to
Macedonia. One hears of them so little and of people
like Meletios so much. This savage person was appointed
in 1859 to be Bishop of Ochrida, although the reputation
he had left there&mdash;having previously been the coadjutor&mdash;was
atrocious. Protests and entreaties were sent to
Constantinople, but from 1860 until 1869 he stayed at
Ochrida and carried on an implacable duel with his flock.
He was frequently received with hisses, sometimes he was
struck by stones, sometimes he was flung out of a church.
But he was not the man to be intimidated&mdash;a large man,
with broad shoulders, an arrogant expression and a
bristling beard; they say he had the appearance of a
janissary in clerical garb. He took into his service an
Albanian bandit, through whom he terrorized the diocese.
At one time he had the young wife of a man who was
away in Roumania brought into his harem. The husband
returned, asked for his wife and succeeded in obtaining
her, but after two months he was assassinated, and the
widow thought she might as well allow the bishop to
console her. The outcry was enormous; no one doubted
that it was Meletios who had given orders for the crime.
A deputation of thirty went to lay this case and numerous
other transgressions before the Patriarch at Constantinople.
He would only receive five delegates, who read
their document in a plenary sitting of the Holy Synod.
After they had recited the afore-mentioned episode, one
of the bishops who was present lost patience and, "Is it
really worth our while to listen to such tales?" he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
"If Christ spoke to the Samaritan woman, why should
not a simple bishop hold converse with a woman also?"
"At last the moment has come!" said the delegates.
They departed, and at the door they shook the dust
from their feet. The Patriarch himself ran after them.
"Come back, my children!" he cried. But they were
deaf to his voice.</p>

<p>About forty years after the reign of Meletios there
was still a Greek bishop at Ochrida, but&mdash;this was in
1912, after the first Balkan War&mdash;the town had also a
Bulgarian and also a Serbian bishop. The Greek ecclesiastic
did not profess to administer a very large flock&mdash;it
consisted of about twelve families&mdash;but he explained
that his presence was made necessary by the ancient
Greek culture. He was there to watch over it. The
local church of St. Clement and the monasteries of SS.
Zaim and Naoum are dedicated to disciples of Cyril and
Methodus, the two brothers who introduced Christianity
to these parts. They may well have recruited their
disciples among the Slavs, whose language they had
learned before they set out. But whether the old stones
which the Greek bishop was guarding in 1912 are Greek
or Slav, he was better employed than most of his predecessors.</p>


<p class="section">THE AFFAIR OF KUKU&#352;</p>

<p>One of the first Macedonian villages to take an independent
attitude had been Kuku&#353;. When it heard that
some French priests were operating at Salonica, and that
if it were converted to Catholicism it would be given a
national clergy and the protection of France, the temptation
was so great that it succumbed. One of the Bulgarian
democrats at Constantinople, Dragan Tzankoff,
identified himself with this idea, not through religious
motives but in order that the Porte should no longer
fear that the independence of the Catholic Bulgarian
nation would be a gain for Russia. This may sound
rather far-fetched; he may have also used Catholicism
merely as a threat by which to induce the Russians to
assist in procuring the Exarchate. Tzankoff and various
other people went to Rome, where Pius <span class="smcap">ix.</span> blessed their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
enterprise and consecrated one of them, the archimandrite
Sokolski, as Bishop of the Bulgarian Uniate Church.
Sokolski was a worthy, patriotic man, but not endowed
with mental attributes such as this post demanded; they
had, however, been unable to find anybody better qualified.
He soon decamped to Russia, for he was down-hearted
when the Church did not attract a greater number of
disciples. His defection was a grave blow to the cause,
chiefly on account of the laughter it excited. Bulgarian
Catholicism had, however, a fair number of adherents at
Constantinople and at Kuku&#353;.... There was at the
same time another movement, more discreetly undertaken,
by American missionaries to convert the Bulgars to the
Protestant religion. These Americans, drawn by the
magic name of Greece, had come to Europe to assist that
people in their fight for freedom. They had built them
schools, had printed educational books in Greek, and had
contributed in every way towards the people's moral
progress; and no sooner was the country liberated than
they were expelled. The Bulgars did not treat them in so
cavalier a fashion, but neither did they adopt Protestantism
as the State religion. Sir Henry Bulwer, the British
Ambassador, recommended them rather to persevere
with Catholicism; it seemed to him that this religion,
with its authoritative organization, would be more
adapted to removing the Bulgars from the influence of
Russia. The Russian Ambassador, the disdainful Prince
Lobanoff-Rostovski, was very much bored by all this
trouble that the Bulgars were giving; the Greeks were
furious. One day a Catholic Bulgar died in the French
hospital at Pera, and a body of Greeks, accompanied by
clergy, wished to have the corpse handed over to them
for burial according to the Orthodox Greek rite. When
they were refused admission they attempted to enter
by force, raising loud cries and threatening to sack the
whole place. In the end they were dispersed by a detachment
of French sailors....</p>


<p class="section">THE EXARCHATE IS ESTABLISHED</p>

<p>These religious disputes between Greek and Bulgar
were agreeable to the Porte, which encouraged the Bulgars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to persevere with the Catholic plan. Russia continued
to be very embarrassed, not wishing to make a permanent
enemy either of the Greek Church or of the Bulgarian
people. Finally the Bulgarian efforts to secure a national
Church met with reward. The Turkish authorities&mdash;Fuad
Pasha, the Grand Vizier, being an enlightened
man&mdash;did not persist in the impracticable plan that this
Church should be in communion with Rome. One of
the consequences of the establishment of their autocephalous
Church was that many of the Bulgarian
Catholics at Constantinople and Kuku&#353; abandoned that
religion. The Vatican complained&mdash;and not unreasonably&mdash;that
it had been fooled. The Russians are generally
given much credit for this Bulgarian success, but although
they participated in the negotiations&mdash;and their Ambassador,
the resourceful Count Ignatieff,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> would make
it seem that they were gratified with the result&mdash;their
situation was so delicate that they preferred to play for
safety. When the news was brought to Serbia it gave
rise to great rejoicings, for the Exarchate was the charter
of liberty for the Macedonian Slavs. No one dreamed
at this time that, on account of Macedonia, Serbs and
Bulgars would be some day flying at each other's throat.</p>


<p class="section">1867: AUSTRIA DELIVERS THE SLAVS TO THE MAGYARS</p>

<p>The Southern Slavs had recently been shown that if
they waited in the hope that others would assist them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
improve their fortunes they would have to have a monumental
patience. When Austria, after her defeat at
the hand of the Prussians, was flung out of the German
federation, she availed herself of the services of a German,
Count Frederick Beust, to put her house in order. His
negotiations with Hungary produced the compromise,
the <i>Ausgleich</i>, of 1867. This Constitution, which made
them independent of each other as regards internal
matters, bade their Slavs prepare themselves to lose all
shreds of independence. The Serbs of the Banat and
Ba&#269;ka, as well as the Roumanians of Transylvania and
the Slovaks, were delivered to the Magyars without any
guarantee that their language or their nationality would
be respected. "Look!" said the Magyars in after years,
when travellers came to see what they had done, "we
have a language law, evolved by Deak, which lays down
that everybody in the law courts has the right to use
his mother-tongue." The traveller had been wondering
what unusual people lived in Hungary, for he had seen
a peasant choose precisely that time when a train was
due to come and quarrel about something with the booking
clerk. How was the traveller to learn that the non-Magyar
peasant wished to buy a ticket for his native
village, whose name had just been Magyarized, and that
the clerk refused to sell a ticket except the peasant used
a name he did not know? And when the peasant had
walked home he might see in the village register that
he who had been Saba was now Shebek and that his
friend Ziva, who could speak no word of Magyar, was
now Vitaljos; and that the children of poor Vitaljos,
in order that they should not suffer from their father's
handicap, were not confining their education to ordinary
subjects, but were learning the Magyar language for
seventeen hours every week. Well, how was your
traveller to know that if a person used his own tongue
in the law courts, which was very probably the tongue
of everyone who lived there save a handful of officials,
one of these officials who was accidentally in court would
say he was acquainted with that person's language?
The judge would take his word for it and he would start
interpreting. When the Hungarians came to deal with
the Croats they were careful to give them, for the world's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
eye, a great deal of autonomy. Strossmayer, assisted
by the historian Ra&#269;ki, had in April 1866 led a deputation
to Buda-Pest when it was clear that extreme
divergencies existed between the Croats and the Magyars.
Among other Croatian demands was one that Rieka
should no longer be the scene of Magyar intrigues. As
yet the town's importance was not great: in 1869 she
had only 17,884 inhabitants and the total of her exports
and imports did not exceed 150,000 tons. But everybody
knew that by the building of a direct line to Croatia
and to the valleys of the Save, the Drave and the Danube
there would come an era of prosperity. The Magyars
had allied themselves with the Autonomist party, showing
them what great advantages the town would reap if it
were joined to Hungary. Would not Hungary, for
instance, be able to manipulate the railway freights?
There had been constant bickerings between the Croats
and the Autonomist party, so that Strossmayer's deputation
asked that the Magyars should refrain from giving
to the latter their financial and moral support. But the
Magyars had no such intention. "One should try to
convince everyone," said Ra&#269;ki, "that in national
politics the Magyars and ourselves stand at the Antipodes.
We see in the Slav and Yugoslav solidarity the most
powerful guarantee for our national future, whereas
the Magyars see in it the tomb of their nationality. We
consider the liberation of the East as a condition of a
happier future, while the Magyars regard it as the beginning
of their absolute ruin or at least as the end of
their aspirations for the sole dominion. The idea of a
Yugoslav State, arising in Croatia or in Bosnia or Serbia,
would always find in Hungary a most determined foe."
It was thus improbable that any satisfactory arrangement
would be made, particularly as the Austrians, oblivious
to all that Jella&#269;i&#263; had done for them, were quite prepared
to give their erstwhile enemies, the Magyars, a free
hand. And what the Magyars did was to confer upon
Croatia this autonomy for educational and legal and
religious matters, while they reserved financial, railway,
fiscal and commercial questions, military legislation and
the laws relating to the roads and rivers in which both
were interested&mdash;all these subjects they reserved for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Parliament at Buda-Pest, in which, of course, the Croats
formed an impotent minority. Francis Joseph on May 1,
1867, sent a message to Zagreb in which he stated that
"the pourparlers with the Kingdom of Hungary, which
to him was always dear and faithful, had led to the
desired results." He trusted that the Croats would be
represented at his coronation at Buda-Pest. Strossmayer
was ordered to bring this about; he went instead to the
Paris Exhibition. He and the National party prepared
themselves for a severe struggle. But now Baron Levin
Rauch, of infamous memory, was nominated as Ban.
He at once altered the electoral laws, so that the National
party came back with only fourteen deputies. If any
one in Western Europe thought about the Croats it was
with the traditional aversion for the way in which they
had behaved to the most noble Kossuth. This was years
before the time when Dr. Seton-Watson, as it may interest
him to hear, defeated the Magyarophil candidate at an
election in the town of Ogulin. The bright idea occurred
to somebody to whisper it abroad that Dr. Seton-Watson
would arrive that day in order to make notes of the
election for the British Press. With Rauch's obedient
majority a compromise, the <i>Nagodba</i>, was arranged with
Hungary. The terms of this, subordinating Croatia
economically and financially to Buda-Pest, are what one
would expect; the chief novelty concerns Rieka, as to
which port no agreement had been reached.</p>


<p class="section">THE "KRPITSA"</p>

<p>On the Croat text of the <i>Nagodba</i>, which had received
the Emperor's sanction on November 8, a piece of paper,
the famous "Krpitsa," was glued; and on this paper
were the words Rieka knew of old&mdash;<i>Corpus separatum
sacr&aelig; coron&aelig; Hungaric&aelig;</i>. They had been put forward
by the Hungarian delegates and approved by the Emperor
on November 17. This rather melodramatic affair would
have been thought worthy of at any rate a few lines by
most of us if we had written a whole book, nay two books,
about Rieka. But our friend Mr. Edoardo Susmel
glides, as gracefully as possible, over it. In his <i>Fiume
Italiana</i> he is as <i>peu communicatif</i> as a carp. His other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
book,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> written in French, simply and beautifully says
of this law of 1868 that it is "a precious heritage transmitted
from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in which
period there was condensed"&mdash;or shall we say made
palpable?&mdash;"the spirit which is jealous of the municipal
liberties." "Down to this day," says he, "Rieka is in
complete possession of her charter. Rieka has to-day
still got her great charter. This constitutional charter ..."
and so on and so on. But these modern coryph&eacute;es
of Rieka and Dalmatia are so forgetful.</p>


<p class="section">RIEKA'S HISTORY, AS TWO PEOPLE SEE IT</p>

<p>Mr. Susmel begins by saying that the origins of the
Italianity of Rieka lose themselves in the story of Rome.
He knows&mdash;none better&mdash;that the Romans came to these
parts. They disappeared&mdash;but of course one can't put
in every detail. Anyhow, they left an arch, a lot of
coins, some vases, etc.; and a few of these are depicted
in Mr. Susmel's book. What a relief it must have been
to innumerable people as they turned his pages and
discovered that he had forgotten to include the illustrations
of our Roman Wall, of the Pont du Gard and of the
glorious aqueduct that traverses Segovia! From the
time of the "Krpitsa" onwards a regular colonization
began. Italians were urged to come from their own
country&mdash;but if Mr. Hilaire Belloc, who studied the
question on the spot, is accurate in his diagnosis that
Fiume is Italian "with that intensity of feeling bred by
alien rule and the sudden victorious liberation therefrom"
(<i>Land and Water</i>, May 29, 1919), it certainly does
seem a little strange that the Italians should think in this
way of the Magyars who invited them and were so good
to them. They were told, no doubt, by the Magyars
that the Croats would not hurt them, that the city council
would always be Italian, that if the saucy Croats asked
for schools&mdash;as indeed their numbers entitled them to do&mdash;well,
they would receive no reply. ("Show me a single
Croat school!" cried the Italian mayor triumphantly
to me in 1919.) The Magyars spent vast sums on the
harbour, making the other little harbours of Croatia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
obsolete, and they were not going to lose their grip of the
town for want of proper legislation. They were surprised
that more "regnicoli" (Italians from Italy) did not
respond; but the renegades made up for them.
"Passionate and justified," said Mr. Hilaire Belloc in
1919,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> is Italian feeling with respect to Fiume. But
this writer, who says he travelled to the Adriatic with a
view to ascertaining the real facts, did not altogether
waste his time, since one of his two adjectives is quite
correct. With regard to the renegades no questions were
ever asked, if only one helped to keep Rieka from the
Croats, if, for example, on a voting paper for the Croatian
Diet one put the word "nessuno" (no one). Mr. Susmel,
I see, says that the Diet's continued invitation to the
town that it should send its deputies to Zagreb was a
display of "incredible obstinacy."</p>


<p class="section">AND THE SLOVENES ARE COERCED</p>

<p>The <i>Ausgleich</i> was of ill-omen to the Slav subjects
of Hungary. It was not much more auspicious for the
<ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Solvenes'">Slovenes</ins>, Istrians and Dalmatians. The Slavs seem to
have been the Habsburgs' nightmare. Why the million
and a quarter of Slovenes&mdash;people who do not approach
the Basques, for instance, in pugnacity&mdash;should be the
butt of everlasting coercion and repression may seem
inexplicable. When the German-Austrians of Triest,
even after the Italians in Italy had begun to claim the
town, allied themselves with the Triest Italians "to
fight," as they declared, "the common enemy," it can
surely not have been these quiet Slovenes who had won
for themselves by great industry a place in the town
which is situated in their province. The "common
enemy" to whom the German-Austrians referred must
have been Russia. And so the Southern Slavs of the
Balkans and of the Adriatic owed part of the bad treatment
they received not to their own vices but to the
organizing virtues which their larger brother was supposed
to have.</p>

state their case, they were taken to a monastery and not allowed to
participate in the religious offices.</p></div>

<p>A wealthy gentleman of Belgrade, one George
Weiffert, who brews admirable beer, is said some years
ago to have sworn an oath that if his wished-for ice, that
was strangely lacking, should appear by Saint Sava's Day
(January 27, New Style) he would adopt this old archbishop
as the patron saint of his family. Another Teuton,
of Hebraic origin, whom I met at Zaje&#269;a, had placed himself
and his house under the protection of the Archangel
Michael, whose festival is on November 21. The Roumanians
of eastern Serbia seem, all of them, to have
assumed this custom which the Serbs call the "slava,"
and those inhabitants, say of Pirot, who did not consider
themselves Serbs at the time of their annexation would
gradually fall into line with their neighbours and select a
saint, if only because the annual "slava" celebration is a
day of tremendous hospitality, when the peasant is glad
to squander his savings in the entertainment even of
persons unknown to him. And those who are in the habit
of attending "slavas" naturally feel that they must have a
"slava" of their own. It may also have happened in
Macedonia that a traveller has been told by the very
adaptable peasants how Saint Nicholas or Saint Alimpija
is their house saint, a commitment which the holy one has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
but lately had thrust upon him. One would therefore do
well to look for some other test, and not to follow those
people who roundly assert that the man who honours the
"slava," and no other man, is a veritable Serb.</p>


<p class="section">WHAT ARE THE MACEDONIAN SLAVS?</p>

<p>If, for example, one wishes to decide whether a given
Macedonian Slav is a Serb or a Bulgar&mdash;many thousands
have been called and have, quite happily, called themselves
both&mdash;we must use a more scientific method.
Some investigators, such as Vateff, have made measurements
that are not without value; others, such as Djeri&#263;
and Shishmanoff, have published good monographs on the
Serbian and Bulgarian name. We have had some learned
dissertations on the language of Macedonia, as to whether
the Slav dialects approach more nearly the Serbian or the
Bulgarian literary language. But this question remains
unanswered, owing to the imperfect manner in which the
grammatical and syntaxical peculiarities of the Macedonian
dialects have, as yet, been examined. Some people
have argued that as the Bulgarian peculiarity of the
postponed article is also found in Macedonia it follows
that the province really is Bulgarian. But as the postponed
article is found in a wide zone, which extends from
the Albanian shores to those of the Black Sea, this
argument loses in strength, for how can Roumania be
called Bulgarian? Very possibly before the Slavs
arrived that zone was inhabited by another people who
left this characteristic behind them, though they left no
documents. It is a logical hypothesis. And Barbulescu,
the Professor of Slav Philology in the University of Jassy,
said in 1912 that "the Serbs have just as many reasons
for asserting that the Macedonian is a Serbian language as
the Bulgars have to deny it." As it was in the Middle
Ages, so it is now; the medi&aelig;val language used to oscillate
between the two, and it is sometimes impossible to
tell whether an old Macedonian Slav document is Bulgarian
or Serbian.... When we come to the ethnologists
we find they have only written books which deal with
certain parts of Macedonia. They have confessed that,
generally speaking, it is impossible to say whether a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
is a Serb, a Bulgar or a Serbo-Bulgar. These Macedonians
were for centuries at such a distance from the other Slavs
and were so thoroughly neglected that they lost their
national consciousness, an attribute which many thousands
of them, in the days of the vast, loose empires of
Du&#353;an and Simeon, never possessed. Sir Charles Eliot,
in his excellent book <i>Turkey in Europe</i> (London, 1900),
says that it is not easy to distinguish Serb and Bulgar
beyond the boundaries of their respective countries. He
divides the Macedonian Slavs into pure Slavs, Slavized
Bulgars and pure Slavs influenced by Slavized Bulgars:
"all three categories," he says, "have been subjected to
a strong and often continuous Greek influence, to say
nothing of the Turks and the inconspicuous Vlachs," so
that in his opinion it is rash to make sharp divisions among
a people who have thus acted and reacted on one another.
A large proportion of the Macedonians<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> have no knowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of the race to which their ancestors belonged; and
one is brought to the conclusion that it is much wiser not
to use for Macedonia the two words, Serb and Bulgar,
but to say that these Slavs became either Exarchists
(in which case they were commonly called Bulgars) or
Patriarchists (who were called Serbs). Basil Kanchov, a
Macedonian, who is the most accurate in giving the
numbers of the Slav population of the old provinces of
Turkey, divides them not into races but religions. It is,
of course, a mistake to think that on the institution of
the Exarchate it merely received the allegiance of those
Macedonians whose origin was more or less Bulgarian.
Thousands of Slavs who were, or believed themselves to
be, of Serbian blood passed over to the schism with the
sole object of obtaining for their Church a Slav liturgy.
There was little reason for them to hesitate, since at that
time the names of Serb and Bulgar implied no national
differentiation, but were used to designate the brothers of
two different provinces. We find then that the Macedonian
Slavs, vaguely Serbs and vaguely Bulgars, passed
pretty indiscriminately, and of course without the least
apprehension of the future, into the Exarchist Church, or
else remained under the Greek Patriarch. Exarchists
and Patriarchists were found in the same family: thus
at Tetovo the priest Missa Martinoff was an Exarchist and
president of the Bulgarian community, while his brother
Momir Martinovi&#263; was a Patriarchist, and president of
the Serbian community in the same town. Stavro, a
well-known watchmaker at Skoplje, was a Patriarchist,
whereas a brother of his, also at Skoplje, was an Exarchist
priest. Ivko, a farmer at the village of Poboujie
and his eight nearest relatives were Exarchists, his other
relatives and all the rest of the village were Patriarchists.
Many similar examples could be given.</p>


<p class="section">THE RIFT CAUSED BY RELIGION</p>

<p>One may observe by the sequence of events in one of
the Macedonian towns, what was the dire effect of this
dividing of the Slavs into two religious bodies. Ghevgeli,
a town which before the War had about 6000 inhabitants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
will provide a fair illustration. In the middle of the
nineteenth century the church service was in Greek and
there was no school, but the Slavs were indifferent&mdash;and
learning was regarded as a rather praiseworthy accomplishment
for the priest. Now and then some one would travel
to where the Serbian or the Bulgarian language could be
heard in church and on his return to Ghevgeli be discontented
with the Greek. This feeling was fanned by
certain agitators from outside; and ultimately a Slav
service was introduced, being celebrated in the same
church as the Greek service and by the same priest. As
he was unable to read a Slav language, the words were
written for him with Greek letters. One should mention,
by the way, that no Greeks were to be found at Ghevgeli&mdash;only
Slavs with a few Turks and five or six Jews. A
Slav school was also opened about 1860, with a teacher
whose salary was paid by the parents; he used Slav
church books and taught arithmetic and folk-songs.
The Greek bishop started a school, but with no great
success, and although it went on until 1913 it was patronized
by fewer and fewer children.</p>

<p>The Slav service in the church became after a time
Exarchist; as a sequel to which, to the dissatisfaction of
many of the people, it was called "Bulgarian." The
objectors had been to Serbia and sympathized with that
country, and at Ghevgeli they were supported by about half
the population. But the Bulgars were then more favourably
viewed by the Turkish authorities.... A Bulgarian
school was likewise opened a few years before the Serbian,
which began in 1882. By this time the Slavs, largely
owing to external pressure, were not content to have two
separate schools; they were the keenest rivals, and the
proprietor of the Serbian school, Risto Naumovi&#263;, was
killed for no other reason in 1883. His successor, one
Be&#269;irovi&#263;, who is still alive, was threatened that he would
be shot within twenty-four hours, but his valiant young
son&mdash;who was then a pupil at the school&mdash;found the
komitadji chieftain who had uttered this threat and slew
him. So both the schools continued, together with a
Turkish, a Greek, a Roumanian and a Catholic school.
The Catholic friars were supported by Austria and France;
the Roumanian establishment, which was visited by not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
more than twenty children from the neighbourhood, was
maintained by Roumania&mdash;the teacher being a native
of Bucharest. In fact, there was a good deal of propaganda
which between the Serbs and the Bulgars became
violent.</p>

<p>What can be said for the Exarchists?... Some
years ago the Albanians in the region of Monastir were
asking to be inscribed on the books of the American
Church, for they thought in that way to obtain the
benefits of American citizenship. They made no pretence
of having been impressed by other doctrines. A
Church was in their eyes a sort of naturalization bureau.
And when the Exarchists were rejoicing in their new-found
strength and perceiving that this Church of theirs might
be a corner-stone of a Great Bulgaria, they were so
completely carried away that they bestowed an all-too-scant
attention on the methods which they brought to
bear. These methods of the enthusiastic Exarchists
were altogether deplorable and succeeded in alienating
not only the Patriarchist Slavs whom they freely murdered,
but even in many cases the very Exarchists, who
came to dislike the komitadji bands, whom they were
required to shelter and to feed and to assist with a subscription
to their funds. "Still more," says a Bulgarian
proverb&mdash;"still more than if you have a boat on the sea
or a Roumanian wife, are you certain to sleep ill if you
have a property in Macedonia." As year after year went
by and the komitadji men appeared to be doing very little
beyond terrorizing the country, those who supported
them began to frown. No guerilla leader presented a
balance-sheet, and it was generally known that the famous
Boris Sarafoff allowed himself, each year, a few months in
Paris. This, he said, was due to him after his arduous
time in the Macedonian mountains. More and more
displeased were the Exarchist peasants&mdash;the Macedonian
Slav is a very thrifty soul&mdash;and in the Great War one had
the spectacle of men who called themselves Bulgars and
concealed their sons, lest they be taken into the Bulgarian
army. "If it pleases the Bulgars," they said, "let them
come and liberate us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>


<p class="section">VERSATILITY OF THESE MACEDONIAN SLAVS</p>

<p>If the Exarchist leaders had gone about their business
with more prudence&mdash;but how could one expect political
sagacity among a people which had not only been for
centuries under the shadow of the Horses' Tails, but which
at the time when the Turk appeared was no whit his
superior in civilization? Very possibly the Balkan
Slavs would in those five hundred years have turned in
disgust from Vlad the Impaler and other exponents of
Byzantine culture, if it had not been for the Turk, who
ignored his raia's potential moral progress and did not
think of regulating his natural cruelty. If the Exarchist
leaders had been born different, then Macedonia might
easily have become&mdash;as now, one hopes, it will at last
become&mdash;a Yugoslav bond of union, instead of an apple
of discord. "I used to be a Bulgar and now I am a Serb,"<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
said a man with whom I was walking one day in Monastir,
"and so long as I have work," he said, "I shall be perfectly
contented." How many Macedonians ought to
echo his words! At Resan I stayed at the house of an old
gentleman called Lapchevi&#263; and in Sofia I had previously
met his brother, whose name was Lapchev and who was
Minister of War. Until 1868 there was at Resan only a
Greek school, so that the elder brother's education left
him merely a Macedonian Slav, who could have become
with equal facility a Serb or a Bulgar; the younger brother
had the advantage of a Bulgarian school, but the disadvantage
of having his Slav nationality narrowed down
into that of Bulgaria. These two brothers should set an
example, renounce the name of Serb and Bulgar, and call
themselves simply Yugoslav. At Resan the Serbian
authorities are certainly trying to smooth away these
wretched divisions. No longer, as in 1890, does the little
town support half a dozen schoolmasters who are nothing
if not Serb or Bulgarian. Now the Serbs of Resan have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
retained not only the priests who were in office during the
Bulgarian occupation, but the male and female Bulgarian
teachers. In the winter of 1869 Ljuben Karaveloff
started his paper, the <i>Svoboda</i>, which was in opposition
to those Bulgars who dreamed of their country being
freed by Russia and placed under a Russian protectorate.
Karaveloff's hopes were centred on an independent revolutionary
movement, and the Bulgars, he urged, could best
achieve their political, as distinct from their ecclesiastical,
freedom by associating themselves with the other Balkan
peoples and especially with the Serbs. "What is required,"
he said, "of the Balkan Christians is union and
union and union."</p>


<p class="section">HOW FOREIGNERS HAVE STIRRED UP TROUBLE</p>

<p>If you stand, soon after daybreak, looking at the
white fa&ccedil;ade of Sofia's enormous, Russian-built cathedral,
you will perceive that whether accidentally or by some
architectural <i>tour de force</i>, the upper part is a majestic face,
the face of some old god, benevolent and quite implacable.
The Bulgars never would deny that Russia liberated them
and showered on them every kind of gift. But woe be it
to them if in return they did not forward Russia's purposes.
Hundreds of young Bulgars were received in Russia and
gratuitously educated; the Church books which the Bulgars
used, their ecclesiastical vestments and sacred utensils
had usually come to them as gifts from Russia; both
before and after the political emancipation Russia's
literature was most assiduously studied. And a pious
care was taken of the places around Plevna that were
memorable for a feat of Russian arms; the people down
to this day speak about "The Holy Places." All was
well until the death of Alexander <small>II.</small> No, all was not
well&mdash;for the Russians had, in their design to make the
Bulgars their devoted Balkan agents, given them by the
Treaty of San Stefano a vast territory which in gratitude
they were expected to administer for Russia's greater
glory. Yes, it may be said, but Russia was using the
best available maps, and these indicated that Macedonia
was Bulgarian.... Perhaps we have already shown
sufficiently that the Macedonian Slavs are devoid of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
innate national sense, but that they have Bulgar or Serb
sentiments which are, for the most part, imported, thrust
upon them or created by the propagandists. Very rapidly
the Macedonian Slavs transform themselves into Serbs or
Bulgars; according to circumstances they will or will
not be faithful to the nationality which they have chosen.
And in their wavering they have thousands of precedents&mdash;towards
1400, for example, a Slav chieftain called Bogoja
attacked the town of Arta, and in order to gain an easier
victory announced, the chroniclers tell us, that he was of
Serb, Albanian, Bulgar and Greek descent. One must
therefore be a little dubious of maps which ascribe the
Macedonian Slavs to any particular nationality. Much
more than the rival maps, it was Kiepert's that was used by
the Russians and others for determining the Bulgaria of
San Stefano. "It is the best map that we know of," said
Bismarck, and Kiepert's ethnographical statements were
completely adopted by British scientists and diplomats at
the time of the Berlin Congress. No doubt a well-equipped
foreigner could obtain more exact ethnographical results
in Macedonia than equally gifted Serb or Bulgar observers.
But not one of the travellers whose observations Kiepert
used for his map was acquainted with the Serb or the
Bulgar language, nor had any one of them travelled for
purposes of research; hence it is not surprising that none
of them perceived that the Macedonian Slavs have no
sense of nationality and that "Bulgar" is not used there
as a national term. In former as well as in recent times
the Macedonian Slavs have readily abandoned one name
for the other, the temporary predominance of either
depending solely on the conquests, political circumstances
and various events, internal and external, which give
rise to certain sentiments and instincts among this people,
easily transforming them into Serb or Bulgar aspirations.
It seems clear that Serbia's existence as an independent
State for a good many decades before Bulgaria was freed
would render the name of Serb more disagreeable to the
Turk; it is therefore not astonishing that in Macedonia
under the Turks one discarded the Serb name in favour of
the Bulgar. Without dwelling upon the more or less
valuable remarks which were made by priests and monks
and Turkish geographers and French explorers and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
German doctors from the sixteenth to the eighteenth
centuries and from which we can at least deduce that the
Slav inhabitants of southern Macedonia were not fanatically
constant to the Bulgar name, it would appear that
in the nineteenth century the earlier deliverance of Serbia
and, above all, the foundation of the Exarchate caused the
Bulgar name to become the more popular. The Serbs
were looked upon by Turkey as a revolutionary element,
while the Bulgars aimed at an independent Slav Church
within the limits of the Turkish boundaries. It is unnecessary
to add that after Bulgaria's deliverance and
her annexation of Eastern Roumelia, and especially
after the rebellious movements in Macedonia, which had
the moral if not the official encouragement of the Principality,
there was less eagerness on the part of the Slavs to
let their Turkish masters think that they were Bulgars.
But in the period preceding the publication of Kiepert's
map the Bulgar name was the more fashionable with
Macedonian peasants. And by giving practical effect to
this map in the Treaty of San Stefano the Russians did a
huge disservice to the Bulgars. In the first place, they
aroused in this young people such an exhilaration that
the subsequent annulling of the Treaty at the hands of the
Great Powers would naturally leave a rankling disappointment.
Also the relations between Serbs and Bulgars
were not rendered easier by the chief Slav nation coming
down so heavily upon the Bulgar side in what necessitated
a most delicate and scientific handling. Three Russian
ethnographical maps on Macedonia were issued by the
Petrograd <i>Slavyansko Ob&#353;t&#269;estvo</i>, which worked for Pan-Slavism
and assisted Slav students. These maps&mdash;one
of them is described by Kntchev, the chauvinistic Bulgar,
as "giving the Bulgars somewhat more territory than they
in reality occupy"&mdash;were lamentably superficial. While
remaining unnoticed in the rest of Europe they exercised
an unfortunate influence on the Balkan educated classes,
who believed that, according to tradition, the potent
"elder brother" would be anxious to decide righteously
the disputes between the small Balkan nations. These
maps were, no doubt wrongly, looked upon as the plans of
Russian policy, and on this account the Bulgars became
still more unapproachable for an understanding or for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
united work; it appeared to the Macedonian <i>intelligentsia</i>,
whose hope was to see their country set free, that Bulgaria
was the land which fortune and the Russians favoured.
Except the foundation of the Bulgarian Exarchate in
Macedonia and the creation of Bulgaria at San Stefano,
perhaps nothing contributed so much to the estrangement
of the Balkan nations as these maps; for it was long before
one could be persuaded that this Slav society had produced
the maps through ignorance and false information, so that,
as Professor Cviji&#263; remarks,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> "the educated classes in
Serbia were as culpable for the pernicious effects of these
maps as were the Russian authors themselves." And
Serbs and Bulgars had good reason to complain of the
manner in which Russia treated them.</p>


<p class="section">AUSTRIAN, RUSSIAN AND TURKISH MAN&OElig;UVRES</p>

<p>While Bulgaria came from the San Stefano peace
dazzled with jewels that she was not to clasp, the Serbs
continued walking in the shadows which had, from the
time of Michael's death, been gradually falling round
them. No practical result was obtained from a letter
which the Serbian Government ordered their representative
to read to the Greek Patriarch, pointing out
that only such parishes should be held as unquestionably
Bulgarian which had formerly been subject to the Patriarchate
of Trnovo, even as those of the Pe&#263; Patriarchate
were undoubtedly Serbian, while those of Ochrida were
disputable, since that region had belonged in turn to
both of them. Small advantage accrued to the Serbs
from their fidelity to the Greek Patriarch: in Macedonia
they came to be regarded by many Slavs as foes to the
new national Church, while the only desire of the Greeks
was to use them for their own purposes. "There are no
Serbs in this parish," wrote a Bishop when the Patriarch
commanded him to permit the Serbian priests now and
then to celebrate a Slav service, "there are no Serbs but
merely Greeks" (in which official terminology the Serbs
were included) "and hellenized Vlachs." ... The Serbs
about this time were most unfortunate in warfare. Prince
Milan tried to secure, without coming to blows, from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Sultan what he expected that his victorious armies would
give him, namely, the administration of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
After the failure of the 1874 crops the peasants
of Herzegovina and then of Bosnia were driven to desperation
by the demands of the tax-gatherers. Miss Irby's
eloquent description<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> tells us of the terrible state of these
provinces during the years that preceded the outbreak.
Taxes of one-eighth were demanded by the Governor,
one-third or one-half by the Beg, taxes for exemption
from military service, taxes for pigs, cattle and everything
"you have or have not." One informant said, "I have
seen men driven into pigsties and shut up there in cold
and hunger till they paid; hung from the rafters with
their heads downwards in the smoke, until they disclosed
where their little stores were hidden. I have known them
hung from trees and water poured down them in the
freezing cold; I have known them chained barefoot
and forced to run behind the Beg's carriage...." The
provinces revolted and vengeance was wrecked upon
them. More than a third of the population fled the
country. Sir Arthur Evans<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> describes the refugees as a
"squalid, half-naked swarm of women and children and
old men, with faces literally eaten away with hunger and
disease.... After seeing every moral mutilation," he
goes on to say, "that centuries of tyranny could inflict
... who can go away without a feeling of despair for
the present generation of refugee Bosnia?" The people
of Montenegro and Serbia were profoundly stirred by
the miseries of their brothers. But Milan vacillated, and
when finally he took up arms it was without success,
and five weeks after the peace signature Russia began the
Turkish War, one of whose necessary antecedents was the
recognition by Russia that the Austrians were not to be
hampered in Bosnia-Herzegovina. (After the Treaty of
Berlin had placed the two provinces under Austria's
administration it is said that Andr&aacute;ssy, on his return
from Berlin, remarked to Francis Joseph that the door
of the Balkans was now open to His Majesty. But the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>Russian delegate, Prince Gortchakoff, had prophesied to
Andr&aacute;ssy that Bosnia-Herzegovina would prove the
Empire's grave.) One effect produced by this incursion
of the Austrian eagles was a serious divergence between
the Croats and the Serbs. By historic and by ethnic
rights the provinces, so the Serbs argued, should be theirs
when once the Turk had ceased to rule. The Croats,
laying special emphasis on the religious question, were for
justifying Austria's occupation. The Catholic Slav clergy,
unlike the Orthodox, ranged themselves with the great
Catholic Power; while Croat politicians of the school of
Star&#269;evi&#263; invoked other historic and ethnic sanctions in
their endeavour to found, under the name of "Great
Croatia," a State uniting all the Yugoslav lands of the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Thus the Serbs and their
Croatian brothers were acutely in conflict. Never, said
the Serbs, would that "Trialism" come to pass, for the
Magyars would veto the formation of a Yugoslav State
within the Empire, having a population roughly equal in
numbers to its own. We Yugoslavs have nothing to
hope for, said the Serbs, except from ourselves, and, being
divided, we are ruining our common interests.... From
yet another quarter was a storm-wind blowing on the
Serbs. The Russian volunteers and officers had taken
back with them highly unfavourable impressions as to the
capabilities of the Serbian army, which they accompanied
in the luckless campaign of 1876; also, in the opinion of the
Pan-Slavists the Serbs had been contaminated by European
civilization, whereas the Bulgars seemed, in the words of
Professor Miliukoff,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> to be the sons of an untouched, virgin
soil, free from politics and ready to work, with all possible
zeal for the "inner truth" of Pan-Slavism, while begging
its protector to concern herself with the "outer truth."
The Bulgars were, for these reasons, to have the preference
in the allotment of the spoils of the Turkish War; and,
owing to the conflicting demands of Russia and Prince
Milan, Serbia did not declare war against Turkey until
several days after the fall of Plevna, so that she could not
hope that the Russians would show any special tenderness
towards her national aspirations. It is difficult to see
what Serbia could have hoped to gain from the elder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
brother, if she had been less dilatory; she gained from
this intervention no vast gratitude from the younger
brother. Men may still be found in Bulgarian frontier
villages who were prominent there during the Serbian
army's r&eacute;gime. Some of the officers seem to have told
the people that they ought no longer to call themselves
Bulgars, since they were Serbs; but the propaganda was
very mild. Serbian schools were opened here and there,
but if no pupils wished to attend them, the schoolmasters
had a holiday; and the occupying troops limited themselves
to collecting signatures on addresses of loyalty to
Prince Milan. No one, probably, thought that the addresses
and petitions were very serious&mdash;no one, that is to
say, except a Dalmatian publicist called Spiridon Gop&#269;evi&#263;,
who printed a large number of them in his handsome,
illustrated book, <i>Makedonien und Alt-Serbien</i> (Vienna,
1889). With regard to Gop&#269;evi&#263; as a savant&mdash;he says
that all the Macedonian Slavs are Serbs&mdash;and there are
equally uncompromising Bulgarian authors&mdash;the celebrated
Slavist Jagi&#263; says that he is sorry for the good
paper which was used for Gop&#269;evi&#263;'s book. Another of
his wonderful discoveries was that the Macedonian Slavs
are Croats. And one of his severest judges is a Croat,
S. Jurini&#263;. He gives, as if they were most valuable, these
fatuous lists of signatures and informs us that some
Bulgarian priests and agitators tried to prevent them
being collected. A Turkish official did, it is true, show in
too Oriental a fashion that he disapproved of these collectors&mdash;on
July 16, 1878, he quartered one Cvetkovi&#263;-Bo&#382;in&#269;e
on the road between Skoplje and Kumanovo for
having obtained 5000 signatures; and after quartering
him, the Turk nailed the four parts of his body, each with
a quarter of the petition tied to it, on to four posts at
a place where four roads met. But many of the more
reasonable Bulgars appear to have recognized that these
activities of some Serbian officers and others need certainly
not embroil the two people; while some other manifestations
of joy, such as when they pulled out the beard of the
priest of Pirot, and after nightfall, in celebration of this
triumph, illuminated the town, those and similar transactions
were treated as the folly of exuberant subalterns;
and Tako Peyeff of Trn, the spokesman of the little,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
far-away town and its representative at San Stefano,
told me that although he refused to sign petitions, yet he
said that if Prince Milan should visit Trn it was the duty
of all men to salute him. Up to this time, then, there
was no veritable friction&mdash;there was only the cloud gathering
over Macedonia; and even when the Berlin Congress
of 1879 adjudged certain towns to Serbia, as a recompense
for the abandonment of any claims on Bosnia, this was
rightly taken by most Bulgars as being far less the fault
of Serbia than of Austria and the other Powers. It is
strange, in fact, that this difficult passage in Serbia's
history was marked by greater animus between Serb and
Croat than between Serb and Bulgar&mdash;and the Serbs were
standing in Bulgaria. Milan had not yet made his ill-omened
remark that the road to Sarajevo went <i>via</i> Sofia.</p>


<p class="section">THE DEPLORABLE MILAN</p>

<p>One of the direst misfortunes that ever came upon
Serbia was Milan, her fickle, headstrong, extravagant
ruler. He was, perhaps, no Serb at all; it had been
given out, when he came as a child from Roumania, that
he was the grandson of the younger brother of Milo&#353;,
but this statement was not universally accepted&mdash;he
lived under the suspicion of being an illegitimate son of
the Roumanian Prince&mdash;and at his first appearance
before the Skup&#353;tina a certain Ranko Tajsi&#263;, a deputy,
refused to rise. "I want that man's birth certificate!"
he shouted. It is not surprising that Milan did his best
to make, from that time onwards, Ranko's life a burden.
If the Prince had been a more satisfactory monarch, his
origin would have mattered little. Many of his attributes
seem to his detractors to be peculiarly Roumanian,
although it is true that extravagance is not unknown in
Serbia, and this was the foible which his subjects, even
when they learned the colossal amount of his debts,
were most willing to overlook. It was only after his
death that the secret treaty of alliance between himself
and his paymasters, the Austro-Hungarian Government,
became known; but the people, and especially the
educated classes, were in opposition to his politics, and
the conflict between him and the Radical party degenerated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
into a revolt that was suppressed by the sword. The
leaders of the party fled from Serbia: Pa&#353;i&#263;, who was
for so many years to be Prime Minister, settled in
Bulgaria where he practised his profession of railway
engineer.... As a benignant-looking patriarch Nicholas
Pa&#353;i&#263; was for a long time the solitary Serb with whom
the well-informed public of the rest of Europe was
familiar. And of course upon his countrymen, whose
fortunes he directed through years of shadow and sunshine,
his hold was tremendous. "May God bless our
dear old brother Nikky," says the peasant as he tastes
his morning glass of rakia. There is no brilliance but a
profound knowledge of human nature in this humorous
old Balkan gentleman. It is not by brilliant oratory
that he sways the Skup&#353;tina, for he merely thinks aloud;
slowly and haltingly, while he caresses his beautiful
white beard, the words come out in a very bass voice&mdash;it
is a grave and confidential talk, although a merry
gleam occasionally dances in his eyes. With such homeliness
does he talk that he pays no strict regard to the
complications of Serbian grammar&mdash;when he appointed
a very able young official of the Ministry of Education
to a diplomatic post some hostile critics in the Press
asserted that he did so on account of his enormous admiration
for a man who had produced eight books on grammar.
As a specimen of Pa&#353;i&#263;'s parliamentary methods we
may quote from a speech that he made in answer to one
by the aforementioned Tajsi&#263;, who was an illiterate but
most eloquent peasant. For three hours Tajsi&#263; had
railed against the secret fund, the 30 million dinars that
were every year at the disposal of the Foreign Office.
At last when Pa&#353;i&#263; gets up and very courteously smiles
at the would-be reformer: "Well, well," says he, "as
to what our friend has told us&mdash;the&mdash;how should I say?&mdash;well,
it is not altogether wrong&mdash;in a way, the&mdash;what was
his name?&mdash;when you examine the matter from all
sides, there is&mdash;I forget the word&mdash;in a way, these non-public
matters, you know&mdash;how should I say?&mdash;it is
best&mdash;how should I say?&mdash;&mdash;" "Are you satisfied with
His Excellency's answer?" says Nikoli&#263;, the Speaker.
And Tajsi&#263; puts it to himself that after all he is only a
peasant and Pa&#353;i&#263; is an Excellency and he must know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
better what one should do. This habit of stroking his
beard used to be adopted by the Prime Minister when his
personal finances were under discussion. Doubtless there
were many who scented something scandalous in the fact
that he possessed half the shares in the Bor copper mines,
which had risen from 500 to 80,000 dinars apiece. He
had bought them, as anybody else might have done.
"Ah well," he was wont to say in that ultra-deep voice,
"you see my wife brought them me." And a large
contribution to his wealth was made by a farmer near
Kragujevac; he persuaded Pa&#353;i&#263; to buy from him for
1000 piastres&mdash;a few pounds&mdash;a meadow on which to put
his horses, and subsequently on that meadow there was
found an excellent spring of mineral water. Once for a
change another political leader, whose Christian name
was also Nicholas, thought he would pull the beard of
Pa&#353;i&#263;, and he did so very vehemently just outside Kolarac,
which is a large restaurant in Belgrade. The Prime
Minister was being followed by a couple of detectives,
but he signed to them that they were not to interfere.
"My darling old Nikky," said he, as he beamed at his
assailant and grasped him tightly round the throat,
"you and I are party leaders, so please don't let us
quarrel. It creates an unfortunate impression, my
friend." And it was some weeks before this man recovered,
for Pa&#353;i&#263; was then about sixty years of age and
still in the flower of his strength. But to return to the
disastrous reign of Milan.</p>


<p class="section">NIKITA THE COMEDIAN</p>

<p>The discontented Serbs could now no longer, as in
days gone by, look hopefully towards Cetinje. Rumours
and something more than rumours were circulating as to
Nikita's character. For many years that very shrewd
person was going to gull the Western world which, meeting
him on the Riviera, was enchanted by his picturesque
costume. But if Queen Victoria and Mr. Gladstone
had gone to ask the Montenegrins they would have found
that he was hated, and not only in the Brda and the parts
bordering on Herzegovina but even in old Montenegro.
His adherents were chiefly to be found among the Njegu&#353;i,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
his own clan, and in the family of his wife. Certain
English devotees of Nikita have actually been to Cetinje,
have, as they proudly tell us, been embraced by him and
have enormously admired his alfresco audiences when he
settled all manner of problems to the perfect satisfaction
of these tourists. Some of them, with a decoration or so
and with memories of dinners and shoots, have written
books that are a song of praise; and if Nikita's subjects
tell these gentlemen and others, including members of
the British Parliament, who have not been to Cetinje&mdash;but
who know just as much as the travelled ones about
Montenegro&mdash;if they tell them that Nikita is a ruffian,
the answer will <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'probable'">probably</ins> be that he who says such things
must have a grievance, and that those foreigners who have
criticized him, Miss Edith Durham, Baron d'Estournelles
de Constant and Mr. Nevinson, are altogether mistaken.
I do not propose to make a long and dreary catalogue of
his iniquities, but only to mention a few items.... It
was in Montenegro a matter of common knowledge that
the wheat which Russia sent in large quantities for his
famine-threatened people was not given but was sold
to them by Nikita, the proceeds being shared by himself
and four or five privileged families, the Petrovi&#263;, Vukoti&#263;,
Martinovi&#263; and Jabu&#269;ani. A member of one of these
families became so affluent that he built himself a house,
and a gentleman who still survives, Tomo Oraovac by
name, wrote on this in the year 1878 a rather humorous
poem which he called "The Red House." Oraovac was
at the time an official, the intendant of the Montenegrin
army at Kotor, and he naturally had to resign his post.
The Tzar sent a certain General Ritter to examine the
charges and, as one result, a Russian decoration was
conferred upon Oraovac; according to etiquette it was
transmitted through Nikita, and that personage gave it
to a friend of his, a Turk at Podgorica. Nikita is apt
to disarm one by the quaintness of his ways. Later on,
Oraovac, who was one of Montenegro's earliest schoolmasters,
organized the <i>intelligentsia</i> for the purpose of
obtaining a Constitution. Nikita was not yet ready to
grant such a thing, and his representative who attended
one of Oraovac's meetings at Podgorica inflicted upon him
two grave wounds. The reformer was then expelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>&mdash;the
powerful intervention of one of Nikita's cousins
saved his life&mdash;his mother and both his brothers, <i>more
Montenegrino</i>, were likewise expelled and his house was
bestowed upon a certain Kru&#353;a, who lived in it for forty
years. One must add, with respect to the Russian wheat,
that Nikita did not sell it for cash&mdash;the wars of that
period had left the land in such distress that no cash was
available. And so the wheat was delivered in exchange
for bonds that would some day become payable. When
the wars of the seventies were over, an edict was issued,
and from end to end of the country, so goes the story,
men had to sell their sheep and cattle and horses, their
sticks of furniture, their land itself, to meet their obligations.
Meanwhile the Austrian frontiers had been closed.
No selling was possible outside the land, and selling within
it was only permitted to certain specified persons, agents
of the Prince, and at fixed prices. The profits were
enormous; the country was ruined, and from that time
date the great emigrations to America, as was pointed
out by Mr. Leiper the Serb-speaking Scot in his admirable
contributions to the <i>Morning Post</i>.... Nikita loved to
bestow things upon himself. A famous hero, Novak
Voujo&#353;evi&#263;, killed seventeen Turks in one day, and when
he went, in consequence of an invitation, to Petrograd,
the Tzar presented him with a sword on which were the
Russian crown and the Montenegrin crown in diamonds.
When the old warrior came back to Cetinje, Nikita said
that such a weapon could not possibly be worn by a
simple man; he therefore abstracted the diamonds and
gave it him with false ones in their place. Nikita could
not endure criticism, but those persons, including myself,
who have charged him with inhuman treatment in the
case of Vladimir Tomi&#263;, an intelligent young judge, were
acting on faulty information. The tale was that Tomi&#263;,
after being incarcerated, was soused with petrol and so
badly burned that he lost his reason. As a matter of
fact, this neurasthenic young man&mdash;whose imprisonment
was due to his having wantonly insulted the whole Royal
Family&mdash;poured the petrol on himself. Eventually,
when Radovi&#263; came into office, he was released and, a
few years later, he died in his native village.... The
Montenegrin records are crowded with the names of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
whom Nikita drove into exile for no other reason than
that they had gone abroad for an education and would
no longer be disposed to regard his methods as quite up
to date. With the exception of the few favoured families
Nikita was all against anyone acquiring riches; he deliberately
put obstacles in the way of plum cultivation,
and in such a state of poverty did he keep the Montenegrins
that the Baron d'Estournelles de Constant, whose
official connection with Montenegro dates back to 1878,
addressed to Nikita an open letter with reference to the
decreasing population, as to which the statistics had
been destroyed. On account of the rigorous taxation
a great many of the people were forced to migrate to
America, from where they sent almost everything they
earned to their unhappy relatives; these were compelled
to pay up to 100 per cent. interest on the loans which
they had been obliged to negotiate, so that they could
not meet the taxes. And there would have been some
consolation had those taxes been productive; but by
far the larger part of them, as of the loans raised in
Vienna (with the Boden Credit and the L&auml;nder Bank)
and at Constantinople were devoted to the Court and
its favourites, for rewards, journeys, decorations&mdash;every
thing in fact, save the needs of the people. It suited
Nikita very well to keep his people in dire poverty and
ignorance. Such has been the poverty of the Montenegrins
that it was no uncommon sight to see them
cultivating so minute a <i>polje</i> that the wheat which it
produced would give no more than half a loaf. And
meanwhile they were not allowed to exploit the wealth
of the forests. Figs, olives, grapes and plums could all
have been cultivated with profit, and in the lower regions
oranges and lemons and tobacco. But there was the
deliberate policy to keep the population from enriching
themselves. Occasionally their native wit gained for
them a surreptitious triumph. Thus it happened that
a poor peasant's son went up into the higher lands to tend
the flocks of one who was more prosperous. By some
means the boy discovered that the mountain torrent of
his new abode dived underneath the rocks and subsequently
reappeared and was the stream which ran past
his old home. He turned this knowledge to effect by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
killing a lamb and throwing it into the water. His
parents, down below, retrieved the lamb. Various other
animals went the same journey, until the farmer ascertained
what the boy was doing; and then the day arrived
when the poor peasant, watching by the stream, saw the
body of his son being carried down towards him.</p>

<p>Very few schools were opened; for example the
Vasojevi&#263;, who are the most numerous tribe not only of
Montenegro but of all the Serbian lands, had to content
themselves with one school, built in 1882. In 1869 there
was established a seminary with three classes, that was
afterwards converted into a high-school of four classes; but
both of these were frequently closed, the true reason being
that the Russian subsidies given for the school were
spent on the various needs of Nikita's Court. (By the
way, at one time when Montenegro had this one high-school
and one hospital the three sons of Nikita were in
possession of ten palaces.) In 1869 the Russian Empress
caused a girls' college to be opened at Cetinje. It was
one of the best institutions in the whole Peninsula;
many Serb and Yugoslav girls, in addition to the Montenegrins,
gathered at Cetinje. This college was the centre
from which education and modern ideas spread out to
the remotest corners of Montenegro; in 1913 it was
obliged to close&mdash;the Court had long been looking at it
with a very jaundiced eye.... Russia, Serbia, Italy,
France and even Turkey offered free education to a
certain number of young Montenegrins. But only the
sons of the favoured families were able to get passports
to go abroad; there was scarcely anything Nikita feared
as much as education.... And if one asks why no
patriot could be found to kill this prince one is given two
reasons, the first being that his semi-secret treaty with
the Austrians provided that they should come into
Montenegro if he were killed, and secondly, because of the
old-time custom of vicarious punishment. In 1856, for
instance, Nikita's father attacked the Po&#269;ara Ku&#269;i,
burned their houses, and is reputed to have slain more
than 550 children, women and old men, including the
septuagenarian grandfather of Tomo Oraovac, on the
ground that these people had set up a kind of republic,
independent both of Montenegro and of the Sultan and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
declined to pay the former any taxes. These measures
were taken against them in the summer when most of the
men were with their herds in the mountains. Three
children survived. The Great Powers protested, consuls
were sent and ultimately the Po&#269;ara Ku&#269;i, who had
always helped the Montenegrins against the Turks,
consented to pay taxes. It was for these reasons that
Nikita was never assassinated.</p>


<p class="section">THE GREAT STROSSMAYER</p>

<p>While the Serbs of Serbia and Montenegro no longer
placed any trust in their princes, they had good cause
to give more and more of their confidence to Strossmayer,
who remained for more than half a century at Djakovo
and never, on account of Magyar opposition, became a
prince of the Church. He saw that the Star&#269;evi&#263; policy
with respect to Bosnia was a retrograde step, since it was
causing the Serbs of that province, who until the occupation
had been on good terms with the Catholic minority
and the Serbs of Croatia&mdash;about 40 per cent. of the
population&mdash;to stand very much aloof from the Croats.
This state of things was naturally very pleasing to
the Magyar imperialist Ban, Count Khuen-H&eacute;derv&aacute;ry,
whereas Strossmayer's Yugoslav idea would have, owing
to the intermingling of the two religions, a particularly
favourable ground in Bosnia. It may be that Leo <small>XIII.</small>'s
conception of drawing back the Slavs to Rome will remain
a dream, but his and Strossmayer's policy of an alliance
would have been a blessing to the Yugoslavs, and primarily
in such provinces as Bosnia and Croatia. Negotiations
were begun in 1882, between Strossmayer and the Serbian
Government, with a view to establishing a Concordat.
Serbia's Roman Catholic subjects&mdash;who, by the way,
were not very numerous&mdash;would be placed under a
patriotic priest depending not on Austria-Hungary but
directly on Rome. And thus the fence between them and
their Orthodox kindred would be gradually broken down.
It would be foolish to assert that Strossmayer and his
fellow-workers were able to make all the Yugoslavs
dismiss their religious differences and remember their
national affinities. Orthodox and Catholic Slav have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
for so long been divided that their approach to one another
must often be slow and is liable to be interrupted by the
man&oelig;uvres of third parties. The Austrians were pretty
successful, just before and during the Great War, in
setting the Catholic and Orthodox Bosniak at each other's
throat, and this antagonism will endure for a while in
remote districts, such as in a certain village of the Sandjak
where one found, in the summer of 1919, that the Catholic
chief official and his wife were compelled to dismiss their
Orthodox maid, since the villagers would not allow her to
continue to serve in a Catholic house. But Strossmayer's
statesmanship went a long way towards breaking down
these barriers. "I have had to set my face against your
mission," said von Khevenh&uuml;ller, the Austro-Hungarian
Minister, to Father Tondini when this Italian Barnabite,
in whom Strossmayer had every confidence, came to
Belgrade. "It is one of our principles, inherited from
Schwarzenberg and Metternich," said the Minister, "that
we should exercise a sort of control over the Serbian
Catholics by having them under the jurisdiction of an
Austrian Bishop." When Strossmayer visited Belgrade,
for the purpose of conducting confirmations, he was
driven at once, amid the booming of cannon, to the royal
palace. And if the negotiations were allowed to drag
it was obviously not due to any Orthodox fanaticism.
Talking of fanaticism, one had instances in Bosnia and in
Slavonia, not long ago, of Catholic priests who discarded
Strossmayer and endeavoured to get their flock to use
a different pronunciation from that of the Orthodox.
It was because he strove to bring them together that the
great bishop was so heartily disliked in Vienna and Pest.
It had been decided in 1883 that, unless he made his
political submission, he was to be interned at the Trappist
monastery of Banjaluka. But if he were no longer in a
position to spend the great resources of the bishopric&mdash;to
say nothing of the removal of his personal influence&mdash;the
Cause would have suffered enormously. Therefore
he listened to the prayers of his friends and submitted.
"Be glad," said he to Radi&#263;, the Croat patriot&mdash;"be glad
that you are not a priest." His successful efforts to
bring about the moral and intellectual awakening of the
Yugoslavs were most unpopular in those two capitals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
But on the wide Slavonian lands and far beyond them
one would find the sturdy farmers imitating his new
methods&mdash;his own estate was so large that he paid 35,000
florins a year in taxes. The tall, thin prelate might be
walking with you in his garden, telling you with simple
eloquence&mdash;and in Latin, for choice&mdash;how much he
regretted that Doellinger had not submitted, as did his
adored Dupanloup, to the dogma of Papal Infallibility,
when one of those painted carts would rattle round the
corner and in two minutes this father of his people would
be deep in a technical discussion with the peasant as to
which of the episcopal stallions or bulls he should borrow
for the improvement of his stock. When Strossmayer
consecrated the cathedral which he had built at Djakovo
he exclaimed that in the hour of his departure from this
world his last prayer would be for the union of his people.
"Almighty everlasting God," he cried, "have mercy
upon my brave people and unite them!" As a very old
man, verging on the nineties, with brilliant eyes peering
out from under a great forehead and physically so fragile
that in walking from one room to another he had to put
his arm round my neck, he was still in every direction
working to this end. Six months earlier, in June 1903,
Khuen-H&eacute;derv&aacute;ry had been recalled and, after his twenty
years of oppression, the young men of Croatia, Catholic
and Orthodox, in harmony with the Slovenes, were forming
the Serbo-Croat Coalition. This was a great step
in the direction of the Yugoslavia which Strossmayer did
not live to see.</p>


<p class="section">RELIGIOUS DISPUTES BETWEEN SERBS AND ROUMANIANS</p>

<p>Between Serbs and Roumanians of the Banat an
ecclesiastical dispute was on the horizon. The Roumanian
Orthodox body had suffered a severe loss through the
Uniate Church, which captured many of the old Orthodox
places of worship. Thus the famous little church of
Huniadora, whose frescoes have been so glowingly
described by Mr. Walter Crane, fell into their hands.
This occurred in many cases at the wish of a small part
of the congregation&mdash;and this part might consist of
gipsies&mdash;whereupon the majority would be obliged to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
build themselves another church. The Greek Catholic
Uniate Church was apt to lose its national Roumanian
colouring and admit the Magyar language, which was
occasionally resented by the faithful. Thus, as the Bishop
of Caransebes (now the Metropolitan of Roumania) told
me, there came into a church at Tergul, near Moros-Varshahel,
a woman with a basket of eggs. When she
perceived that she could not understand the language
that was being used she put down her basket and uttered
a loud curse, "May thunder and lightning strike this
church!" she cried. And after the service had begun in
a church near Grosswardein the wife of a clergyman pulled
the priest's beard, while other ladies tore off his robes.
Nevertheless this Uniate Church continued to exist and
it was natural that the Orthodox Roumanians should
seek in some way to compensate themselves for their
losses. They had, as we have mentioned above,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> been
given hospitality by the Serbian Church and given the
use of a monastery for the education of their priests.
They now suggested that it would be well if the Serbs
handed over to them a number of the Banat monasteries,
and when the Serbs declined they started a great lawsuit
at Buda-Pest. Professor Iorga, the historian, told
me that he thought his countrymen were justified in that
these monasteries were originally neither Serbian nor
Roumanian, but Roman Catholic, being erected, in pursuance
of their propaganda, by the French dynasty which
the Hungarians had over them in the fourteenth century.
Their nomenclature, said the Professor, is neither Serb
nor Roumanian, they had no privileges from Serb or
Roumanian princes and he believed that they only passed
to the Serbs after having been abandoned by the Catholics.
A line on p. 145, vol. i., of the <i>Monumenta Vaticana Hungari&aelig;</i>
(Buda-Pest, 1887):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Item Stephanus Sacerdos de Beesd solvit I fertonem"</p></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">appeared to lend colour to this view, for the name Beesd
might have been slavized into Besdin and this might be
the record of a payment made, between 1332 and 1337,
to the Pope. It is only fair to say that the learned
Magyar Jesuit who presides over the episcopal library at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Gjula Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r (Alba Julia in Roumanian) did no more
than say that these surmises were possible. He was, as
a matter of fact, much more interested in the political
situation and in another book, the oldest printed Bible in
Roumanian (of 1582 and in Slav characters) which, as he
pointed out with half a sigh, was published by one Magyar
through the liberality of another. The charming Bishop
of Caransebes, as he sat with me one Sunday morning in
his rose garden, did not receive Professor Iorga's idea with
approbation. The Professor, he thought, was too fond of
originality and he himself preferred to claim some of the
monasteries on equitable instead of on historical grounds.
They were founded after all, he said, for the people
of the Banat and of those a majority were now Roumanian.
(But in Caras-Severin, the chief stronghold of his countrymen,
there are no ancient monasteries with the exception
of some ruins. The Roumanians are not ostentatiously
religious; they do not take kindly to the building of
churches and in their portion of the Banat one usually
finds churches of wood, some of these being 150 years old.)
But another librarian, this time a German at Ver&#353;ac,
poured cold water on Professor Iorga. Only one Roman
Catholic religious house, he said, was founded by that
French dynasty in the Banat and this was at Egres, near
the Maro&#353;, where the wife of Louis of Anjou built a church
which remained Catholic and is now in ruins. The
monastery of Besdin was founded in 1539 and a Serb-Slav
psaltery which is kept there has, on p. 270, the following
words: "In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
So that all people shall know when a beginning was made
to build the monastery of Besdin. It was begun in the
year 7058 from the creation of the world, that is 1539 from
the Birth of Christ ... Joseph Milutinovi&#263;, archimandrate,
built it, and his monks and the Christians helped him.
Written by me: Leontic Bogojevi&#263;, administrator and
monk." <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Bessd'">Beesd</ins> and Besdin, said the librarian, are from
the same root, signifying that which has no bottom, an
abyss, and the marshes in the Banat are numerous. The
Beesd of the above citation is, said the librarian, a place
between the rivers Temes and Berzava; Catholics were
there in the fourteenth century, but the founders were
Slavs. The burly archimandrate of Besdin, whose constitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
had withstood twenty-seven years of marshes
and mosquitoes, was extremely scornful of his adversaries'
pretensions. "They wanted to prove that they built it!
Not one stone, not a single stone! Then they argued that
something was due to them as they had paid a part of the
church taxes. We had invited them!" ... Most of
the Serbs acknowledge that their monasteries in the
Voivodina, as elsewhere, are not under present conditions
as meritorious as in the Middle Ages when the people from
twenty or thirty villages would meet there and listen to
the blind guslar-player. Sometimes one of their few
monks is a man of erudition, such as the well-known
Bishop Nicholai Velimirovi&#263; or Ruvarac the great historian,
who in thirty years freed his monastery from debt and
left large sums for charities. On the other hand we have
the archimandrate Radi&#263;, who ruled several monasteries
in succession; he never drove with less than four horses
in his carriage and he drove so recklessly that between
eight and sixteen horses were rendered worthless every
year. The Radical party desired, after paying fixed
salaries to the archimandrates and monks, to give two-thirds
of the rest to clerical funds and one-third to schools.
But the Austro-Hungarian Government had an understanding
with the clerical party and prevented the public
from exercising any control over these funds. The twenty-seven
monasteries in the Voivodina, Syrmia and Croatia
could have supported three Universities, so richly endowed
are they with lands; the Roumanians did in fact
with some of the revenues of their one monastery of
Hodosh maintain the Arad seminary. There is no knowing
what other monasteries the Roumanians would have
secured if the Great War had not intervened, for the
Pest judges knew every morning which of the two litigant
countries their own country happened to prefer.</p>

<p>What the Serbs of the Banat had, in the political world,
to contend against may be illustrated by some incidents
of the career of Dr. Svetozar Mileti&#263;, who after having
been a deputy for twenty-five years was charged with high
treason for having sent volunteers into Serbia at the time
of the Serbo-Turkish War; even if this was true it can
scarcely be said to have constituted high treason against
Hungary. The witnesses against him were two forgers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
released <i>ad hoc</i> from prison, his own witnesses were hundreds.
He was condemned to six years' imprisonment, at
the expiration of which he was in such a state that he had
to be transferred to an asylum, where he died. The
pitiful dodges of the dominating Magyar minority are by
this time well enough known; it was their argument that
certain villages, say ten miles from a town, had to give
their votes in that town, while intervening villages of
other nationalities were obliged to present themselves at a
booth twenty miles in another direction, because if such
methods had not been employed then the more ancient
and more reputable Magyar culture would have been
entirely swamped by the wicked non-Magyars. Thus
the three million Slovaks in Hungary were represented
at Buda-Pest by three deputies.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> "Hungary," says the
delicious Aubrey Herbert, M.P., in the <i>Oxford Hungarian
Review</i> (June 1922), "Hungary was situated amongst reactionary
neighbours, and any loosening of her hold upon
the non-Magyar population threatened her very existence.
The path of spectacular liberalism was closed to her...."
The ballot was supposed to be secret in the towns, where
the Magyars could hope to exercise an appropriate control;
but even in the towns they thought it more advisable to
take no risks. Some of the dead were permitted to vote;
but only if they were faithful Magyar dead. And in
Dr. Mileti&#263;'s constituency no arrangements were made to
ferry the living&mdash;on the large lake of Mutniatsa the boats
were hidden and the voters were compelled to swim
across.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 2em">Although a great many of his subjects charged
Prince Milan with preferring his own and the dynasty's
interests to those of the State, they should have taken into
account that the Berlin Congress had left their country
in a more than difficult economic and political situation.
Not only were Serbia and Montenegro kept apart, but in
the intervening territory, the Sandjak of Novi Bazar,
permission was given to Austria-Hungary, of which she
soon availed herself, to establish garrisons. Serbia was
now almost encircled by the Austrians and there remained
only two inconvenient routes for the exportation of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
products to other countries: down the Danube, with the
very high tariffs imposed by the Berlin Congress, or by the
line to Salonica, which was in the hands of Austrian
capitalists and ran through Turkish territory. Therefore
Serbia's independence, political and economic, existed at
Austria's pleasure; and this must be remembered in
extenuation of the secret Treaty<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> (June 23, 1881) whereby
the Serbs bound themselves for ten years to abstain from
any propaganda or other activity against the Habsburgs
and to make no political treaties with other Powers without
the knowledge and consent of Vienna. Nor were any
foreign troops or volunteers to be allowed into Serbian
territory. In return for this the Emperor undertook to
recognize Prince Milan as King whensoever he might be
pleased to assume that dignity (as he did on March 6,
1882), to protect his dynasty from the Karageorgevi&#263; and
to favour his acquisition of as much as possible of the
valley of the Vardar. The grateful Prince affirmed this
Treaty (on October 24, 1881) by a still more emphatic
declaration by which he appears to have constituted
himself a vassal of the Emperor. This infuriated the
young politicians whose radical ideas, mostly imbibed at
Paris and Geneva, were not balanced by the moral and
social discipline which is the fruit of an advanced civilization.
As a result Serbia was given over to chaos....
When Prince Alexander of Battenberg aquiesced in his
Bulgars annexing eastern Roumelia it was said that he
was violating the Berlin Treaty, but it is now known<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
that, in spite of the 1879 Treaty, this union had been
foreseen and approved by Germany, Russia and Austria-Hungary
in 1881. Nevertheless Austria, which hoped to
embroil and enfeeble the two Slav States, urged Milan to
declare war against the Bulgars, and this he did the more
willingly as he fancied that it would divert from him the
enmity of so many of his subjects; but this war was such
an unpopular enterprise that the King did not dare to
mobilize fully, and with his available forces indifferently
equipped and badly led, the upshot was that the Bulgars
were victorious. While Austria had thus been the Serb's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>evil genius, Russia, by withdrawing all her officers from
Bulgaria, again acted in a manner which seemed scarcely
to allow her and others, in 1915, to denounce the Bulgars
for their ingratitude. (The Russians, as a subsequent
Russian Minister at Sofia relates,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> so completely mishandled
the situation in the early days of Bulgaria's
freedom that they had only themselves to blame for the
invitation to Ferdinand of Coburg which was made with
the express purpose of thwarting Russian aggression.)</p>


<p class="section">THE BURDEN OF THE OBRENOVI&#262;</p>

<p>The fratricidal Serbo-Bulgarian conflict of 1885 has
been well commemorated by a monument at Vidin: a
soldier of the victorious Bulgarian army is depicted,
prostrate in sorrow.... Milan, after an effort to rule
with a new liberal constitution, abdicated and delivered
his country to a Regency. These statesmen, who were
aware of the secret convention with Austria, obstructed
the development of the country and had recourse to a
<i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> in order to prevent a Radical election. Alexander,
the ill-fated son of Milan, by another <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>
proclaimed himself of age, summoned a Radical Cabinet
and restored to the people their political liberties. But
the enthusiasm caused by these proceedings was not often
to be roused again by Alexander. The midnight <i>coups
d'&eacute;tat</i>, which rapidly succeeded one another, were a form
of government congenial to this gloomy, silent, friendless
youth who blinked at the world through his spectacles
and was incapable of seeing anything except the narrowness
and the intrigues that were a part of his surroundings.
More and more he showed himself a despot; he persecuted
and imprisoned hundreds of Radicals, who were the
overwhelming majority of the population. Espionage
was rampant, the finances were in a state of chaos and
Serbia's prestige was at such an ebb that, what with the
disasters of 1885 and the reign of Alexander, the Macedonian
Slavs were naturally more inclined to proclaim
themselves Bulgars. Alexander annulled the constitution,
imposed that of 1888, annulled this one also, superseded
all the judges of appeal as well as all the councillors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of state, married his mistress (an engineer's widow) and
plotted, it was said, to nominate as heir to the throne
his brother-in-law, a worthless young lieutenant. Meanwhile
this officer and his brother were exasperating the
people of Belgrade by commanding the orchestras in
caf&eacute;s to play the national anthem at their entrance, and
occasionally, while they drank, firing their revolvers into
the air. It was something more than personal exasperation
which brought about Alexander's death. Those who
participated in the murder were both partisans and
opponents of the dynasty. Likewise the Austro-Hungarian
Government was aware of the plan: Count Goluchowski
promised the conspirators that Austria would
not resort to armed interference, although two army
corps were held in readiness to march into Serbia. Of
course it would have suited Austria much better if the
king, who seemed to be emancipating himself from the
veiled tutelage accepted by his father, had been dethroned
and kept by the Ballplatz as a restraint on the political
waywardness of any successor. Some of those who
entered the palace on the night of June 10, 1903, may
have had their intentions changed by the panic which
was caused owing to the lateness of the hour and the
groping along unlighted passages&mdash;the electricity was out
of order&mdash;but amid the band of executioners there may
very well have been some who recognized that, for Serbia's
future peace and welfare, it was infinitely preferable that
he should not live. From practically the whole nation
there came, when they heard of his death, a sigh of relief;
he was killed by the detestation of his subjects. Yet
there might have been, in the people's state of nerves,
an outbreak against the actual murderers and this might
have inaugurated a reign of terror if Pa&#353;i&#263; had not walked
up and down in front of the palace, wearing a bowler hat
and buttonholing everyone he saw. "Most unfortunate,
most unfortunate," he said; "they were both drunk, and
so they killed each other." Meanwhile, machine guns
were being mounted at appropriate spots, but they were
not required. And Austria published to the world a
few abominable incidents that accompanied the deed and
followed it; these were almost wholly untrue, yet they
served to make not only Western Europe but even the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Sultan hold up their hands in horror. Abdul Hamid
raised those hands that were dripping with the blood
of hundreds of thousands of Armenians, and in exalted
phrases, says Mr. Laffan,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> lectured the Serbs on the undesirability
of assassination.</p>

<p>A younger man than King Peter Karageorgevi&#263;, who
now succeeded, might have been appalled by the difficulties
of the situation. Murder and the rearing of pigs
were universally regarded as the purposes for which God
had created the Serbs, and years were to elapse before the
little country could persuade the world that it was not
inhabited by beings who approached the lower animals&mdash;and
then the world perceived that it was, to a great
extent, inhabited by heroes. When King Peter ascended
the throne the Royal Families of Europe congratulated
each other that they were not related to him, and they
sympathized with Nikita of Montenegro for having this
personage as a son-in-law. The indebtedness of Serbia&mdash;she
owed 450,000,000 francs, a sum which swallowed
a quarter of the annual budget&mdash;the corruption of the
public services, the lack of industrial development, the
rudimentary state of agriculture and whatsoever else of
evil which the Obrenovi&#263; had done or left undone&mdash;everything
was the fault of King Peter. A great many people
were positive that Alexander had been slain by his myrmidons;
for this foul deed he had been always plotting,
from the time when he fought as a lieutenant in the
French army of 1870-1871 (when he was wounded and
decorated), during the Bosnian insurrection of 1876 (when
he served the national cause) and while he was translating
Mill's <i>Treatise on Liberty</i>. These liberal activities
were held as the absolute proofs of the hypocrisy of
Europe's outlaw. In a few years "old Uncle Pete," as
his people affectionately came to call him, was revered
by the men not only of friendly countries but even by
those who were in arms against him.</p>


<p class="section">A HAPPY ADVENT</p>

<p>He started by placing the government in the hands
of the Radical party and by showing that his own position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
would be strictly that of a constitutional monarch.
Numerous reforms were undertaken with respect to the
finances, the exploitation of the country's resources and
the reorganizing of the army, which had been debilitated
by intrigue and corruption. So many tasks had simultaneously
to be accomplished that the greatest Serbophil
may have despaired, since the national qualities do not,
as yet, include much power of organization. Is it not
astonishing, therefore, that in a few years so much was
done?&mdash;the army, for example, becoming so closely identified
with the people that high Obrenovi&#263; officers felt that it was
unpatriotic to perpetuate these dynastic divisions, and
gradually they resolved to offer their swords to the State.
More than one General whose abilities in the Great War
gained him a high British decoration had once been
conspicuous for his enmity to the Karageorgevi&#263;. With
regard to Serbia's international standing we have the
fact that in 1899-1900 it was impossible to arrange a loan
of 40 millions at Vienna even though the entire railway
system was offered as a guarantee; in a few years various
loans, with relatively easy terms, were contracted for
amounts of 90, 110 and 150 millions. One saw the peasant,
who a short time before had sold his harvest while it was
still green (zeleno) to the local usurer (hence called the
"Zelenac"), now demanding every day by telegram <i>via</i>
Belgrade or Smederevo the market prices at Antwerp.
In 1895 Serbia had sunk to such depths that a Dalmatian
leader said openly to a German journalist that the Yugoslav
idea could only be realized by Bulgaria; in 1910
the "Narodna Odbrana" (or Organization for National
Defence), that was not, as the Austrians alleged, a nursery
for murderers but a patriotic body&mdash;it no doubt reminded
the people of their brothers in Macedonia, the Voivodina
and Bosnia, but at the same time urged them to cultivate
the land more rationally, to visit the doctor rather than
some old woman, to dress, sleep and eat in accordance
with hygiene, and to take steps against illiteracy&mdash;in
1910 the efforts of the "Narodna Odbrana" had had
such success that an inquiry, in which the French participated,
found that out of a hundred recruits from a
backward region 61 per cent. could read and write, 99
per cent. had some knowledge of the battle of Kossovo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and the reign of Du&#353;an, while 82 per cent. could enumerate
the provinces inhabited by their unredeemed brothers.
The rise of Serbia was due to the happy direction that was
now given to the virile spirit of the people; standing back
to back in their own land, they were soon able to arouse
the despondent hearts of their countrymen who languished
under various tyrannies outside the national frontiers.</p>

<p>Those who in Old Serbia acknowledged their Serbian
nationality were the constant victims of Albanian intolerance.
One massacre followed another&mdash;that people
which, according to some of its present champions, is
mild and noble and misunderstood, with a particular
aptitude for silver-work and embroidery&mdash;Miss Edith
Durham asks that this poor nation should not be robbed
of its country, its one ewe-lamb, which they love intensely
and which, to everyone's admiration, they defend
with great heroism; one cannot expect her, the Secretary
of the Anglo-Albanian Committee, to refer to the numerous
lambs, etc., which the Albanians, armed with machine
guns, carried off in 1919 from a Serbian monastery near
Tetovo; and in 1903 the Albanians, waiving their mildness,
appear to have been more conspicuous in attacking
others than in defending themselves. The monks of the
old Serbian patriarchate of Pe&#263; were obliged to have
Moslem and Albanian attendants, and it does not strike
one as heroic when the monks themselves were murdered,
so that the great monastery of De&#269;ani had perforce to be
served by Russian monks from Mt. Athos. Far distant,
indeed, was the day when those Albanians, who called
themselves, after a river, the Fani, went to the assistance
of Du&#353;an. They had been brought to a temporary
standstill by the swollen waters of the Drin&mdash;"but,"
exclaimed one of their chieftains, "for a hero every day
is good." They crossed the river and Du&#353;an gave them
the name of Mirditi, by which they are still known, "mir
dit" signifying in their language "good day." Not
only were the Serbs compelled to don Albanian raiment&mdash;the
Orthodox priest who ministers to Djakovica had,
in 1903, to put aside his Serbian head-dress on leaving
his quarter of the town; when making an official visit
his head-dress was Greek and always in the surrounding
country it was Albanian. Mr. Brailsford found, in June<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
1903, that the Serb peasants were tenants at will, exposed
to every caprice of their Albanian conquerors; both at
Pe&#263;, he says, and at Djakovica there was no law and no
court of justice. In 1903 at M&uuml;rzsteg, near Vienna,
Francis Joseph and the Tzar concluded their Macedonian
reform scheme, this rather futile arrangement paying,
as one might suppose, not much deference to the Serbs.
In Bosnia also and in southern Hungary the Serbs were
in a humiliating position.</p>

<p>But the Serbs in the little kingdom strove manfully
to put their own house in order and to encourage their
brethren. What is known as the "Pig War" was waged,
with astonishing success, against the Austrian Empire;
by sending her live-stock and meat overland to Salonica, her
cereals down the Danube, Serbia managed to break down
the barriers behind which the Austrians had intended to
control her economic life. The measures adopted by
Stojanovi&#263;, the Minister of Commerce, were confirmed by
the Skup&#353;tina and enthusiastically supported by the
whole people, regardless of the accompanying privations
or of any bribes held out by the Austrians. Thus when
the Austrians reduced the fares on their well-equipped
Save and Danube vessels, these were still boycotted in
favour of the Serbian boats. One morning at &#352;abac a
civil servant had embarked on the Austrian ship, while
everybody else was crowding on to the much smaller,
slower and less cleanly Serbian rival. The civil servant
was being vigorously hissed, when he shouted across to his
compatriots that as he was an official he had a free pass
and he thought it a good plan to make the Austrians
consume, simply for him, a certain amount of coal....
The young men of the <i>intelligentsia</i> were not idle.
&#381;erjav for the Slovenes, Krisman for the Croats, Yovanovi&#263;
and Ne&#353;i&#263; for the Serbs, were eagerly at work to bring
about the union of the Southern Slavs. They had some
sympathizers in Bulgaria, but that country was too much
oppressed by Ferdinand and the Germanic influence.
Both &#381;erjav and Krisman were destined to become
Ministers in the South Slav Parliament, which of course
does not yet include Bulgaria. Ne&#353;i&#263;, who was the
diplomat of the Serbian movement, became Consul at
Pri&#353;tina, took part in the Balkan War, for instance at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
siege of Scutari, as an artillery officer, and after some
years found himself inside the town as Yugoslav Envoy.
He is now Minister at Tirana, a delicate post which could
not be in better hands. Ljuba Yovanovi&#263; was the
idealist whose work was to arouse his fellow-countrymen
by articles and poems. In the war against Bulgaria he
was wounded and in hospital contracted cholera. On the
day of his death he wrote to a brother of Ne&#353;i&#263;, now one of
Belgrade's leading lawyers; he was utterly grieved, he
said, that brother-Slavs should have shed each other's
blood, but he was certain that the day of union would
come.</p>


<p class="section">AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN WRATH</p>

<p>The first external result of Serbia's efforts was seen in
1905, when forty young intellectuals of Croatia, Dalmatia
and Istria met at Rieka and, while accepting the union of
Croatia with Hungary, called on the Serbian political
parties to join them. Twenty-six Serbian deputies met
at Zadar, endorsed this policy and formed with the Croats
the Serbo-Croat Coalition, to which the Slovenes also subscribed.
Francis Kossuth, the Magyar Opposition leader,
welcomed with eloquent phrases the idea of an alliance
between his party and the new Coalition; but when he
came into power he forsook this attitude and exhibited
the ordinary Magyar ruthlessness&mdash;he himself introducing
a bill to make the Magyar language obligatory on Croatia's
railways, and if a prospective Croat passenger did not
know what name the Magyars had given to his old home
and could not ask for a ticket in the Magyar language,
he was told to stop where he was until he had acquired
the necessary knowledge. In general, the Magyars had
no reason to be dissatisfied with the sort of knowledge that
the world had of them. In 1907, when a funeral pall was
spread over the liberties of the Croats, Serbs, Slovaks and
Roumanians in Hungary, Mr. Roosevelt, who was making
his famous tour, gave many bouquets to "immortal
Hungary," the "virtuous," the "chivalrous." The
Serbo-Croats tried, by every possible method, to hold out
against Buda-Pest. A Ban&mdash;Baron Rauch&mdash;was appointed
with the special purpose of breaking the Coalition;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and when the Serbo-Croats obtained fifty-seven
seats out of eighty-eight, although one-half of the electorate
consisted of employees dependent on the Government, an
order was issued proroguing the new Diet.</p>

<p>In fact the Austro-Hungarian authorities had resolved
to suppress any Yugoslav union. To the Dalmatians,
who were in need of schools, roads and railways, they
said, "Show us first that you are patriotic subjects of the
House of Habsburg." Necessities, as Hermann Bahr
has pointed out<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> were thus turned into rewards, which
were to be the fruit of years of toil....</p>


<p class="section">THEIR MONTENEGRIN FRIEND</p>

<p>The association of the Montenegrin Royal Family
and the Habsburgs, which was to culminate in the barefaced
treachery of Lov&#269;en, may be said to have begun in
the year 1906, when the two heirs, Francis Ferdinand
and Danilo, met at Dubrovnik. A statement was issued,
after a few days, which declared that Russia was far away
and that Montenegro required the support of a Power
whose help would be effective. If it had not been for the
disasters of the Russo-Japanese War, Nikita would have
found it much more difficult to direct his country in this
manner. The Black Mountain had always thought of
Russia as all-powerful; her defeat, when they could
bring themselves to realize it, was to them as if the foundations
of the world were rocking; in their dazed condition
they agreed that it was well to have recourse to Austria.
(When the Russian Minister at Cetinje protested, some
explanation was given.) The financial details of the Dubrovnik
agreement are unknown, but from what one does
know of Danilo it is fairly safe if we assume that the
whole benefit did not accrue to the Montenegrin Government.
Danilo may in other respects have been an incapable
young man&mdash;the advice of his unmarried sister,
Xenia, was always preferred to his; in fact, her father
had such confidence in this masterful woman with the
pallid face and large, black eyes&mdash;the "femme fatale," as
her enemies have called her&mdash;that he never gave an
audience but she was present, either openly or behind a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
screen. Danilo's incapacity, however, seems to have
stopped short, as we shall see, at the procuring of cash.</p>

<p>In that same year, 1906, Montenegro's first Skup&#353;tina
assembled. Many people wondered why the autocrat
bestowed a Constitution and a Skup&#353;tina upon his
subjects. They for their part&mdash;at least the great majority
whose knowledge of the world was gained by looking at
it from their mountain fastnesses&mdash;could never for a
moment doubt but that the Montenegrins were the
grandest and the noblest of the Serbs. Hour after hour of
peace they spent, disdaining to do any work more arduous
than smoking cigarettes and drinking rakia, and talking,
talking ... they would relate to one another what
their ancestors had done by way of cutting Turkish
noses, and unweariedly they would announce how their
own blood was undiluted and heroic. If Greater Serbia
was to be created it was surely they who&mdash;but Nikita, their
keen-witted ruler, was not so certain. The Karageorgevi&#269;
were no longer being treated by Europe as outlaws; by
his constitutional methods King Peter had not only effected
vast and needed improvements in his country, but
was gradually winning for himself and it, if not a general
esteem, at all events the first approach to that condition
which for so long had been lacking. And Nikita was
uneasy. He must also have a Constitution in his country
and a Skup&#353;tina. Very well he knew that with the inexperience
of his people, with their furious local rivalries
and with his power of veto, he would not be greatly
hampered by this Skup&#353;tina. It would be a semblance of
modernity.</p>

<p>Nikita had no intention of allowing himself to be put
in the shade by the Prime Minister. Whether it was
Tomanovi&#263;, a kindly man of straw, or General Martinovi&#263;,
an upright soldier, or anybody else&mdash;their function was
to execute the royal orders. The differences which separate
one political party from another in a Balkan State,
and separate them very often into frantically hostile
camps, are wont to be minute as to their principles, for it
is largely a question as to whether you are a devotee of
this or of that statesman. Two of the three parties which
existed in Montenegro down to the Great War were both
grouped round the Crown Prince Danilo, and apparently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the sole difference between them was that no member of
the Miu&#353;kevi&#263; Cabinet had been in prison. To a western
European it would be surprising that the kindred Radovi&#263;
party should also be on terms of close friendship with
Danilo, seeing that it consisted of Nikita's dissatisfied
relatives (one of these was Radovi&#263;'s powerful father-in-law)
who disliked the new statute which limited the
Royal Family to Nikita and his children. Danilo protected
this party for personal reasons. As for the third
political party, that of General Martinovi&#263;, its principal
plank was its opposition to the other two parties. Mita
Martinovi&#263; himself was not much of a politician; he was
a sturdy friend of Russia. Of his rivals, Lazar Miu&#353;kevi&#263;,
a bearded, rather stout, medium-sized man, has a pious
opinion of his own abilities, and is, or was, very proud
of his friendship with Danilo. He need not be taken
seriously, for he has no knowledge of administration, no
political courage and no popular support. [During the
Great War he was for a time the Premier, and after the
War, when the other five ex-Premiers ranged themselves
against Nikita, he stayed in Switzerland, where he tried for
many months to make up his mind.] Andrija Radovi&#263;, a
middle-aged man, whose tall, athletic form is crowned with
the head of a grave poet, was erstwhile a favourite of
Nikita's. Being related to the Royal Family, Nikita
called him his fourth son, and when, after the fatuous
bomb conspiracy (of which more anon), Radovi&#263; was lured
back from Paris and sentenced to four years' imprisonment,
it was not because he was in any way guilty, but on
the ground that he knew what was going to happen and
should have handed on the information. The real reason
was that any party which was even to a mild extent in
favour of reforms did not meet with the approval of the
Gospodar. In his opinion it was necessary to reduce
Radovi&#263; to obedience; and Nikita used to try, without
success, to force the innocent prisoner to beg for pardon.
Since he declined to do so, he remained incarcerated with a
large cannon-ball chained to his left leg. While he was in
prison he corresponded with Danilo, and on being liberated
was received by Nikita&mdash;they wept in each other's
arms.</p>

<p>Nikita fancied he was just the man to govern a progressive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
modern State. When he had the famous old warrior
Pero publicly flogged by a criminal for having refused to
degrade himself by flogging that same criminal, Nikita
might plead that he was acting in the interests of discipline.
When he confined his critics in the old Turkish
fortress on the small, malarial island of Grimojuri, with
the water oozing into the cells, he might plead that this
was precisely the same curriculum as fell to the lot, at
San Juan de Ulloa, of those who incurred the displeasure of
Porfirio Diaz, the Mexican President&mdash;and Diaz had been
almost worshipped (till his fall) by many Europeans.
When Nikita drove one afternoon with friends of his to
Nik&#353;i&#263; and approvingly looked on while they destroyed the
building and the whole machinery of Montenegro's weekly
newspaper, which had departed from the paths of adulation&mdash;well,
I see that his apologist, a certain Mr. A.
Devine,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> says that "in 1908 political passions resulted in
the extinction of the organ of the political Opposition,
<i>Narodna Misao</i> ("The National Idea")."</p>

<p>In 1908 there fell the blow of Bosnia-Herzegovina's
annexation to the Empire, thus placing definitely under
foreign sway the central portion and ethnically among
the purest of that Serbian people which was already
divided into seven different administrations or States.
Russia was still enfeebled by the Japanese War, and
although she and Great Britain protested against the
annexation, Count Aerenthal was able to gather this
booty. It would, however, be an exaggeration to say
that Russia&mdash;apart from the ultra-patriotic Press&mdash;was
violently excited. As M. Nekludoff, the able diplomat,
explains,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> his country was annoyed not so much at the
Bosnian annexation as because there was for it no <i>quid
pro quo</i>, no free passage through the Dardanelles. Poor
Serbia was advised by the Great Powers to accept the
<i>fait accompli</i>. She constrained herself to do so, but both
she and certain folk in Austria were under no illusions
as to the inevitable&mdash;a month after the annexation a
Viennese newspaper announced that a conflict with
Serbia and Montenegro could not be avoided. "The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>longer we postpone it," said the paper, "so much the
more will it cost us."</p>

<p>One gets very weary of hearing the phrase "Divide
et impera," which always occurs at least several times in
the course of an exposition of Austrian policy. But we
are bound to say that this principle governed her behaviour
when she stage-managed in 1908 the Zagreb high-treason
trial,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> which was to drive a wedge between Serbs and
Croats, in 1909 the Friedjung case, as also the Cetinje
bomb affair which was to, and did in fact, alienate Nikita
from his son-in-law, the Serbian King.</p>


<p class="section">AUSTRIA GIVES HOSTAGES TO HISTORY</p>

<p>The Zagreb trial was conducted by a man who gave
a good impersonation of Mr. Justice Shallow. "There is
nothing to laugh at!" he cried, when a Serb doctor
was asked whether he did not refuse to wear cravats
because of the resemblance of that word to Croat. The
whole farce resulted, not as one might have expected,
in the collapse of the prosecution but in thirty-one convictions,
varying in length from five to twelve years.
The Croats, however, had thwarted Austria's schemes.
They remained true to the Serbs, acted as their counsel
without payment and helped to support the families of
the poorer prisoners. At the Friedjung trial this professor,
an eminent historian, produced a series of photographs
of documents which were subsequently shown to
have been fabricated at the Austro-Hungarian legation
in Belgrade; he wished to prove that a political club in
that town was guilty of a most extensive plot involving
the Yugoslav territories of the House of Habsburg.
Among those whom these proceedings and those at
Zagreb brought into European prominence were the
Pribi&#269;evi&#263; brothers, a very zealous family of Croatian
Serbs, that is to say Croats belonging to the Orthodox
Church. [The chief of these four brothers was Svetozar,
a statesman whose Serbo-Croat Coalition party was,
with the advent of Yugoslavia in 1918, to form the nucleus
of the Democratic party. He then became for many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
months the all-powerful Minister of the Interior, a man
with the appearance of a bull-dog in whose veins is
electricity. The vehemence of his methods of centralization
is supported and opposed by his countrymen with an
almost equal vehemence.] ... But to return to the
events of 1908 and 1909&mdash;the result of these two trials
was lamentable from the Austrian point of view. More
success attended her efforts in Cetinje, for Nikita was
intensely roused against his son-in-law, and the European
reputation of Serbia was again dragged down to the level
of the day which saw the murder of Alexander and his
Queen. An individual called Nasti&#263; whom, according to
Professor Friedjung, one could only touch with a pair of
tongs, accused the Serbian Royal Family of attempting to
blow up their picturesque relative, under whose roof, by
the way, Princess Helen of Serbia, his grand-daughter,
happened to be staying. The bombs were carried in an
ordinary portmanteau to Kotor, where they were discovered.
Those who believed that Nikita, the arch-intriguer,
was using this method for discrediting the
Karageorgevi&#263; dynasty, can point to the fact that he
never wanted a public trial, and it seems probable that
Nikita&mdash;who was aware that a group of his young, discontented
subjects was planning against him a demonstration,
but nothing more than that, even though there are
in the Balkans a certain number of people who incline
to the throwing of a bomb when their British equivalents
would write to the <i>Times</i>&mdash;it seems probable that Nikita
may not only have stolen their thunder but have put
the lightning in their pockets and have then indignantly
revealed it. But the whole affair is wrapped in darkness
and awaits the exploring of Austria's archives. The
probability is that Aerenthal was at his work to demonstrate
that Belgrade was a nest of vipers, so that Europe
would not hearken to their protest when the time came
for the House of Habsburg to smother them.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> ... This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
same Austrian police-spy Nasti&#263; had procured for Nikita
a certain "revolutionary statue" which that personage
made over to the Imperial authorities, for use against the
Serbs at the Zagreb treason trial. This atrocious deed
against his brother Serbs destroyed for ever the last
shreds of Nikita's reputation.</p>


<p class="section">THE DREAMS OF AN OLD REALIST</p>

<p>Nevertheless he dreamed that from the mighty castle
which looks down on Prizren he would rule the Southern
Slavs; his eyes were ever turned towards the famous
legendary land of Old Serbia. One essential was that
he should be a king, and in 1910 with the consent of the
Powers he assumed this title. The spider-webs of which
he was so fond began to join Cetinje and Sofia, Cetinje
and the mountains of Albania, while the master-weaver
mitigated in his usual fashion the monotony of life in his
poor capital. The Petrovi&#263; have such a way with them
that&mdash;if you do not happen to be one of their subjects&mdash;you
are in danger of being disarmed. Thus when they
were basking in the goodwill of Austria and when Nikita
himself, in the spring of 1911, had been splendidly received
at Vienna, so that on his return to Cetinje he was welcomed
by the whole diplomatic body, save for the Russian
Minister, Count Giers, and General Potapoff, the Russian
military attach&eacute;, who were exhibiting their Government's
disapproval, this appeared to Nikita a favourable moment
for&mdash;as the Persians would say&mdash;blackening the face of
the Austrian representative.</p>

<p>It was said by many of his discontented subjects
that the King of Montenegro's great solicitude for his
own personal affairs caused him frequently to be quite
dull in recognizing other people's merit. But that day
when he received the Austrian Minister he was so very
much delighted with him that he there and then gave him
promotion from the second to the first class of the Order of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Danilo. He had some months before conferred upon this
gentleman the second class, with diamonds of paste, and
when the Austrian now told the King of his appreciation
of the honour being so profound that he had ventured to
replace the other diamonds with real ones&mdash;"I am
enchanted," said the King, "to see that we have such a
real friend in you, and I propose to grant you," said the
King, as he produced another star composed of imitation
diamonds, "to grant you this, the most exalted class.
Your Excellency has deserved right well of our beloved
Montenegro. Give me back now that inferior decoration,
and to-morrow, with due ceremony at eleven o'clock to-morrow,"
said the King with his paternal smile, "we will
bestow on you what you deserve so richly, and it gives
me every satisfaction, I assure you," said His Majesty.</p>

<p>The Malissori of Albania were also listening to the old
man's blandishments. If they would revolt against the
Turks&mdash;they were exasperated at the time against the
Young Turk rule&mdash;then their families would be sheltered
in Montenegro and their land, after it had been liberated,
would be given independence. With the potent help
of Ferdinand of Bulgaria the Turk was to be overthrown.
But nothing came of all these plans; the Malissori were
abandoned to the mercy of Constantinople.</p>

<p>However, in 1912 that which had been thought impossible
was brought about: Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece
and Montenegro were allied against the Turk. "Onamo,
onamo!..."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Yonder, yonder!&mdash;Let me see Prizren,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For it is mine&mdash;I shall come to my home...."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">but Nikita, who had written these famous words and
who had taught them to his people for a generation, had
no cavalry&mdash;in the Montenegrin mountains they would
have been of no avail&mdash;and thus, while his warriors were
still some hours from Prizren, they had the mortification
of hearing that the Serbs had entered it. With passionate
desire they turned to Scutari. Nikita told them of the
old Slav princes who were buried there&mdash;and to the simple-minded
Montenegrins that seemed a good enough reason
why 20,000 of them, the flower of the army, should lay
down their own lives on the dreary hills that barred them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
from the town. It was hardly necessary for Nikita to
allude to the wealth that would be theirs if they could
gain possession of this outlet to the Adriatic. There in
the plain at the end of the lake was the glittering white
town, and if they could have seen themselves as clearly
and their own inadequate resources, they would have
refrained from the attempt. The minarets of Scutari,
raised like so many warning fingers, failed to warn them.
Their equipment was such that munitions and other
supplies were frequently carried up to the lines by women&mdash;on
the Bardonjolt no less than eighty of these were
killed and wounded in one day. When the Serbs in October
pushed through Albania to the Adriatic they offered to
assist in the taking of Scutari, but Nikita shook his head.
And it was not until some time after this that he accepted
the co-operation of three batteries of Krupp guns, which
had been meanwhile taken from the Turks at Kumanovo.
But the Montenegrin army was not only handicapped
by its lack of resources; the Crown Prince, who commanded
a division, actually instigated a revolt among
his own men. He had promised the Austrian Minister,
Baron Giesl von Gieslingen, that the Montenegrin army
would not enter Scutari, and the Government could only
put a stop to Danilo's intrigues by invoking the aid of
General Potapoff. The Turks were not wasting their
time; they employed Austrian engineers to strengthen
the fortifications, and thus the task had become far more
difficult when finally the Montenegrin Court party availed
itself of Serbian reinforcements. In more ways than one
they were badly needed by the brave but ill-disciplined
soldiers. "It is wonderful," they said to Major Temperley,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
"their troops do not fire until an officer gives the word."
Primitive men and a venal commander&mdash;according to Dr.
Sekula Drljevi&#269;, who was Minister of Finance and Justice,
Prince Danilo is alleged to have remembered, just before
his country's entrance into the War, that money could be
made on the Vienna Bourse by judicious selling and, after
the declaration of war, by purchasing. The professional
financier who on this occasion, thanks to his knowledge
of the Montenegrin royal plans, is alleged to have realized,
with his friends, the sum of 140 million francs, was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
less a person than Baron Rosenberg, whose subsequent
operations in Paris at the beginning of the Great War
and in Switzerland during the War received the close
attention of the French authorities.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> These financial
methods of Danilo's did less material harm, at any rate
to his own people than the system he employed as a
motorist; it was necessary that he should obtain the
latest models, and it suited him that the Government,
not haggling over the price, should take over his discarded
vehicles. Similar hostages to gossip were given
by Mirko, his younger brother; one remembers the smiles
of the diplomatic corps at Cetinje when this young man
dispatched, at the cost of the Government, a telegram
of about 500 words to Austria, concerning a horse which
he wanted to buy. Mirko, who died during the Great
War in an Austrian sanatorium, was not one of those
rugged and valiant Montenegrin mountaineers whom
Gladstone and Tennyson celebrated; once when his
father ordered him to come back from Paris, where he
was copiously spending his country's substance on an
actress with whom he had decamped, leaving his wife
and several young children at Naples, he dutifully returned
and settled down in his palace, a large, comfortable house
outside Podgorica. Since it was less amusing than in
Paris he remained in bed for most of the twenty-four
hours; he would often spend an hour before dinner in
superintending the removal of pictures from one wall to
another, and having dined he would immerse himself in
State affairs, which took the form of speculating as to
when he and his heirs&mdash;Danilo being childless&mdash;would be
called to rule over the great Serbian kingdom of Serbia
combined with Montenegro. As to the fate of the Karageorgevi&#263;
dynasty, this was wont to vary from night to
night, in proportion to the amount of wine that Mirko
had drunk.</p>

<p>These events occurred in 1913, and in the same year
the Montenegrins entered Scutari. It was not brought
about by force of arms, but by some arrangement with
Essad Pasha, the illiterate and clever Albanian who
succeeded to the command of the town after Hussein
Riza Bey, the Turkish leader, had been assassinated on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the threshold of Essad's house, where he had been dining,
by a couple of the Pasha's men, disguised as women.
Scutari was not to stay for long in Montenegrin hands;
an International Force arrived, under Admiral Sir Cecil
Burney, and took it over. One need scarcely add that
the national sentiment of the Albanians moved the Powers
at this juncture as little as it moved the Albanians.</p>


<p class="section">VERY HIGH POLITICS</p>

<p>We have seen that Prince Danilo, before flinging
himself against the infidel Turk, is alleged to have
transacted a little business on the Bourse&mdash;a former
Montenegrin Minister of Finance says that he may well
have netted between 25 and 30 million crowns&mdash;and
his royal father, though his methods often had a tinge
of medi&aelig;valism, was not the man to rush, like some
old knight, in succour of distress. When Serbia was
attacked in 1914 he refrained from flying to her side.
Montenegro "stood up spontaneously to defend the
Serbian cause: she fought and she fell," says Mr. Devine.
There is not the least doubt but that the vast majority
of Montenegrins would have acted in this fashion. To
some degree they had deteriorated under the example
of Nikita&mdash;"A fish stinks from its head," says a Turkish
proverb; but when their brother Serbs were in deadly
peril all else was forgotten. And they were bewildered
and suspicious when the Skup&#353;tina was summoned, seeing
that the Constitution laid it down that the declaring of
war was a royal prerogative. As practically every man
was thirsting for battle&mdash;after all they were Serbs and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
incapable of committing high treason against their
brethren&mdash;they marvelled at the King's delay. But to
the politicians his man&oelig;uvre explained itself; they
recognized that Nikita had some secret arrangement<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
with the Austrians and that he wanted to tell Francis
Joseph that the War had been forced upon him. From
that moment he was playing a double r&ocirc;le; a Serbian
officer was chief of the Montenegrin staff. "They have
placed my army under Serbian command," he told the
Austrians. "So faithful was I," he said to the Entente,
"that I even took a Serbian commander."</p>

<p>In view of the persistent pro-Nikita propaganda
which subsequently reared its foolish head in Great Britain,
it is as well to note what were the sentiments of the
Montenegrins towards their own country and their brother
Serbs, and on the other hand how they regarded Nikita.
Alone among the Allies the Montenegrin soldier received
no decorations either in the Balkan wars or in the Great
War, and yet he had formerly been so proud of such
recognition that it had often been carved upon his tombstone,
and when for one decoration there were two claimants
a duel was frequently arranged in order to decide which
was to be the recipient. But Nikita's r&eacute;gime of corruption
and intrigue caused these marks of distinction to be conferred
more and more upon police-agents and such like,
so that in the Balkan War, when the heroes could no
longer be counted, when more than five standard-bearers
fell one after another in carrying the same standard and
when it was proposed to decorate <i>en bloc</i> the Ku&#269;i brigade,
the soldiers refused to accept what had been so profaned.</p>


<p class="section">THE RIDDLE OF SARAJEVO</p>

<p>On June 28, 1914, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand,
heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was murdered at
Sarajevo.</p>

<p>In the course of July 1914 the Austro-Hungarian
Government (wherein far more influence was exerted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Count Tisza, the wealthy and incorruptible, the vastly
ambitious Magyar Prime Minister, than by the Foreign
Minister, Count Berchtold, the courteous, somewhat
frivolous man of the world who was doomed to execute
reluctantly the orders of Berlin and be swept away by the
resulting storm, while the brave and brutal Tisza, fighting
for the glory of the Habsburgs and the greater glory of the
Magyars, rode upon the storm for years)&mdash;the Austro-Hungarian
Government in July 1914 dispatched to
Sarajevo a commissioner for the purpose of investigating
whether the Serbian authorities had anything to do
with the Archduke's assassination. This official, Baron
von Weisner, a very distinguished Professor of Political
Economy who was a German Bohemian<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> with staunch
German sympathies, reported in the same month that he
was convinced that no accusation whatever could be
levelled against Belgrade. (As a matter of fact the
Serbian police, who had information that a plot was being
hatched in Bosnia, gave warning to the Austrian authorities;
but no notice was taken of this, not even when a
similar warning was uttered on June 21 by the Serbian
Minister at Vienna, nor were any special precautions
laid down for the Archduke's safety. It was all rather
mysterious.) "Byzantium, the everlasting and unconquerable
Byzantium," says an Austrian publicist,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
"had won another victory.... The Habsburg Empire,"
says he, "only wished to defend herself against those
invisible and irrepressible intrigues." And after denouncing
the Serbs for throwing a spark into the powder
barrel on June 28, 1914, he accounts for their conduct by
writing that "it is the tradition of nomad blood to tear
down ancient, noble palaces, replacing them by nomad
huts." What we know is that General Potiorek, the
Governor of Bosnia, who had urged Francis Ferdinand
and his wife to continue their programme after the failure
of the first attempt at assassination before lunch, was
never invited to explain anything&mdash;unfortunately for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>Austria he was placed in command of the "punitive
expedition" into Serbia. Other incidents on which a
light may some day be thrown were the very unceremonious
funeral arrangements for the murdered couple (though
this may very likely have been due to the High Chamberlain's
personal hatred of the Archduke), and the fact that
an Imperial Commission was sent to Konopi&#353;t&#283;, the
Archduke's Bohemian estate, to seize his papers. It
was there that he had lately been confabulating with the
German Emperor; and Count Berchtold had visited the
place on the day after the Kaiser's departure to try to
ascertain what had occurred.... It was also at Konopi&#353;t&#283;
that Francis Ferdinand, who was threatened with
hereditary madness, had shot a gamekeeper dead. Knowing
that the Archduke was as good a shot as he was
insignificant in horsemanship, this had excited great
attention in the highest circles, coming as it did after other
scenes of violence.... In contrast with all these semi-mysteries
it is clear that Serbia had nothing whatever to
gain by the Archduke's disappearance, and although
Austria had time and again endeavoured to pick a quarrel
with her she had managed to avoid a situation which,
after the two recent wars, would be perilous in the extreme.
The Serbian Press, which enjoyed a complete freedom,
was naturally violent in tone when it observed that the
Austro-Hungarian Government was doing little to control
the demonstrations hostile to Serbia. Houses of prominent
Serbs were looted and gutted at Sarajevo, while
similar scenes took place&mdash;with the connivance of the
authorities&mdash;in other large towns of the Monarchy. But
the Belgrade populace, uninflamed by their Press, conducted
themselves with great moderation. The stories
circulated in Austria-Hungary of several Magyar journalists
having been murdered were absolutely false.
Just as false were the rumours of a demonstration against
the Austrian Minister at the funeral of M. Hartwig, his
Russian colleague, although Serbian public opinion ascribed
the sudden death of this powerful friend of theirs
to a cup of poisoned coffee at the Austrian Legation.
Hartwig has been criticized for his encouragement of
Serbia's idea of expansion and for having fostered anti-Austrian
propaganda&mdash;of course it was a very wicked thing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
from the Austrian point of view, to think of the day
when the Serbs might be joined to their unredeemed
brethren; and as for the blessed word "propaganda,"
which covers everything from the mildest expression of
opinion to assassination, there has been no responsible
Austrian so reckless as to accuse the Serbs or M. Hartwig
of having had recourse to methods that approached in
wrong-doing their own notorious (and unsuccessful)
forgeries.</p>

<p>Let us address three questions to those who carried on
a calumnious campaign against Serbia:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="list">(a) Why was the Sarajevo trial conducted behind a
closed door? If the crime was instigated and
perpetrated by Serbia, the Habsburg Monarchy,
which at the time of the trial had already
declared war on Serbia, had every interest in
establishing with all publicity the guilt and the
complicity of Serbian circles.</p>

<p class="list">(b) Why were the evidence of the witnesses and the
declarations of the authors of the assassination
not published? It was only in 1918 that the
Austrian Government, with the help of a professor
of Berlin University, published a few facts
taken from the proceedings of the trial. Although
in this book<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> a great deal of material
importance has been omitted&mdash;for example, the
declarations of the witnesses as well as the last
declarations of the accused, nevertheless that
which we have before us constitutes one of the
most terrible accusations against the Habsburg
Monarchy. The young accused persons were
not afraid to state, even behind closed doors
in a barrack-room, some bitter truths concerning
Austria-Hungary. One can have some idea of
what they would have said in a public trial from
the results of the famous trials of Zagreb and of
Friedjung. All the accused persons, as well as
their accomplices, declared that the decision to
kill the Archduke was an act of their own personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
will and that nobody incited or ordered them to
make the attempt, least of all any authority of
the Kingdom of Serbia. The crime was the
personal act of Bosnian patriots who believed
that they were serving their oppressed people.
"In Bosnia," said the Minister Burian&mdash;"in
Bosnia, there is no policy, there is only administration."</p>

<p class="list">(c) Why did the Sarajevo police and Austro-Hungarian
official circles conduct themselves so strangely
with respect to the bomb-thrower &#268;abrinovi&#263;, a
notorious anarchist and son of a Sarajevo police
spy, who had on a former occasion been expelled
by the police from Sarajevo? Later on, after
the Belgrade police had been obliged, owing
to the intervention of the Austrian Consulate,
to allow him to stay in Belgrade, he returned
to Sarajevo and was quite unmolested by the
police, whose precautions a few years previously,
at the time of the visit of Francis Joseph, had
gone so far as to expel, as suspected persons,
two members of the Bosnian Parliament.</p></div>

<p>The sole charge that could be laid, not against Serbia
but against a Serbian subject, concerned the relations of
the subordinate officer Tankosi&#263; with the authors of the
crime. It was asserted that he knew of the plan and that
he helped the assassins to procure money and weapons.
The accused definitely said that he exercised no influence
on their decision, which had been taken before conversation
with him. But even supposing that he was an accomplice,
it is evident that the whole Serbian nation and especially
the Serbian Government is not identical with an
officer who, on account of other troubles with the Ministry
of War, had already been removed from the active service
list.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> When the Austrian ultimatum was transmitted
to the Serbian Government, Tankosi&#263; was immediately
arrested, so that his guilt and complicity might be enquired
into and established. Serbia could not do more
than that. But the whole Serbian people, in Serbia and
out of Serbia, was declared guilty of the crime, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
immediate steps were taken to carry out the sentence.
The unprecedented atrocities committed by the Austro-Hungarian
army in Serbia were to be the expiation of an
imaginary crime, and such proceedings, which recall the
times of Attila, are shielded by the illustrious name of
the aforementioned Professor Kohler, whose reputation it
was to be the most democratic of German jurists. All his
previous theories on crime, causality and responsibility
became void; we see him adopt the monstrous theory
according to which every act of private persons is the
responsibility of the whole nation.</p>

<p>It remained for Nikita, a man of Serbian blood, a
man whose verses had been laden with love for the Serbian
nation, it remained for this shameless Prince to charge
his brothers with the crime. So implacable was the
old man's hatred of Serbia that when President Wilson
arrived in Europe he immediately wrote<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> to him, in his
indifferent French, for fear, he said, lest the intrigues
conducted by the Serbs or their accomplices should precede
him in capturing the President's sympathies. "In
spite of their perfidy," said he, "I was the first to lend
them a hand by being the first to declare war against
Austria, although I was certain that the provocation
originated on their side by the Sarajevo murders and their
Black Hand.... Horrible thought that this country
refuses to realize the crime it has committed, for which it
is responsible to mankind no less than William!"</p>

<p>At last, on January 5, 1917, the <i>Neue Freie Presse</i>
acknowledged that Austria provoked the war with the
intention of crushing Serbia. It is a formal and categorical
confession. And it obliges us to consider seriously the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
thesis put forward by Jules Chopin in <i>Le Complot de
Sarajevo</i> (Paris, 1918), according to which the plot was
hatched at Konopi&#353;t&#283; between the German Kaiser and
the man to whom the plot proved fatal. Monsieur
Chopin, after a minute examination of the facts and of
grave presumptions, believes that Serbia was to be held up
to the world as having provoked the war that was to
consolidate the Monarchy and satisfy the Archduke's
paternal ambitions. The army man&oelig;uvres were to be
in Bosnia, the Archduke was to make his ceremonial
entry into Sarajevo on Vidov dan, the day when the
Serbs solemnly celebrate the battle of Kossovo, and
&#268;abrinovi&#263;, son of the Sarajevo <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'policy-spy'">police-spy</ins>, was to be
assisted through the Chinese Wall which then encircled
Bosnia. But what did not enter into the royal calculations
was the possibility that other Southern Slavs,
acting on their own initiative, might strike a real blow.</p>


<p class="section">THE MISERABLE MACEDONIANS</p>

<p>This period of Yugoslav history (from 1876 until the
European War) was at the beginning much concerned
with Macedonia. And so it was towards the end. Very
wretched was the lot of the Macedonian Slavs&mdash;occasionally
the Exarchists and occasionally the Patriarchists
were in the ascendant, but while in religious matters the
Greeks clung by all possible means to their ancient,
privileged position, so the Turks maintained in secular
affairs the sorry plight of their Slav raia. The Macedonian
Slavs, when the rest of Europe began to listen to
their cries, were not the most sympathetic of mortals&mdash;the
more enterprising of them had abandoned the country,
while the moral sense of those who stayed was grievously
affected by the course of conduct which the presence of
the Turk compelled. Europe was touched by the anguish
of these Christians and did not inquire too closely as to
the proportion of the virtues, often called the Christian
virtues, which they cultivated. And it was undoubtedly
a fact that their treatment left a great deal to be desired.
The peasant was obliged to pay direct imposts in cash.
There were taxes on landed property, on cattle, on sheep
and on fruit-trees, tithes on every species of harvest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and a poll-tax to which only Christians were liable,
amounting to ten shillings per annum for every male.
To complete the exactions with a touch of irony, there
was also an education-tax and a heavy road-tax for the
upkeep of the indescribable highways. These taxes
were not collected by Government officials, but were
farmed out to the highest bidder, and so flagrant were
the abuses of this system that it was not unusual for the
villagers to cut down their fruit-trees in order to avoid
the tax upon them, for the tax-farmer, against whom an
appeal would be worse than useless, was wont to appear
with gendarmes and estimate, according to his fancy,
the amount of any crop.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Another tax very frequently
imposed upon the helpless peasant was the tribute to
some Albanian chief, who in return undertook to protect
the village. And if the village was outside the Albanian
sphere of influence it was usually obliged to have its own
resident brigands, who might or might not be Albanians.
Generally speaking, those villages were the least to be
envied which were on the borders of Albanian territory:
cattle were lifted, crops of corn or hay were carried off
before they could be garnered, young men and old men
were kidnapped and held to ransom; sometimes, says
Mr. Brailsford, they were fettered and driven to the fields
at sunrise with the cattle and were forced to work there
until evening. Most of the villages in Macedonia were
owned by a Turkish bey to whom the peasant was obliged
to give a clear half of the harvest, besides a certain amount
of labour on the bey's private farm and in his mill, as
well as hewing wood for him and transporting his produce
to the market without payment. It is not surprising
that the Macedonian Slavs, whose labour brought them
such inadequate reward, sank into very slothful habits.
Thus at Monastir in 1914-1915, when the population had
the choice of taking flour from the Serbian Government
or else the British Consul's bread, which came from India,
most of them&mdash;to save themselves trouble&mdash;preferred the
bread, though with the Serbian flour they could have
baked themselves just twice as much.... When Europe
took up the Macedonian problem towards the close of
1902 there had been a considerable revolt, followed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
an outburst of official ferocity and the flight of some
thousands of peasants. The Sultan, in the hope of
forestalling any Russian interference, promised various
reforms. But Russia and Austria proceeded to discuss
what each of them would do in Macedonia, and one resolve
was that they also, being the two "interested" Powers,
would institute a scheme of reform. The Western Powers
for a time abdicated their responsibilities and left the
miserable Macedonians to the supervision of the two
countries which, as they themselves said, were the least
disinterested. Now and then the other Powers made a
suggestion, as when Lord Lansdowne, who was in favour
of autonomy, made in January 1905 a number of proposals
which would have assisted the solution of the
problem. But Austria and Russia would only accept a part
of his programme. Their own programme, drawn up at
M&uuml;rzsteg in September 1903, was plainly of a transitional
nature. It announced to the different Balkan peoples
that the end of their serfdom was approaching, and thus
it accentuated their latent rivalries and hostilities. Greek,
Serbian and Bulgarian bands ravaged the country.</p>

<p>"The Serbo-Bulgarian conflict," said Dr. Milovanovi&#263;,
a Serbian Minister of Justice, "has its origin exclusively
in the chauvinistic circles of both countries. Macedonia
is the battlefield." He said, very rightly, that the population
of Macedonia was equally near to Serb and to Bulgar;
but unhappily, in his efforts to establish a <i>modus vivendi</i>,
he proposed that Macedonia should be divided between
the two countries. Surely it is far better that it should
become the common possession of Serb and Bulgar, the
link joining them to one another. After Dr. Milovanovi&#263;
came the Balkan wars, of which the second utterly
destroyed for many a long day his hopes of an understanding,
since the experiences of the invaded Bulgars
were generally very different from those recorded by the
careful schoolmaster, Stavri Popoff, in his monograph,
<i>The Self-Defence of the Village of Ciprovci against the
Serbo-Roumanian Invasion of 1913</i> (Berkovica, 1915).
This isolated village in the mountains was defended by
thirty old reservists, who possessed 100 guns and 15,000
cartridges. So pleased is their historian with the manner
in which they held their own&mdash;the rocks which surround<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Ciprovci are so many natural fortresses&mdash;that he tells us
not only the names of the thirty warriors but those of the
other inhabitants who carried milk and bread to the
outposts. On July 14, a Sunday, there was an exciting
battle, in the course of which the Bulgars suffered no
human casualties, but lost to the Serbs 900 sheep and
a score of cattle, and this, says Popoff, "made the women
weep very much." As soon as possible a telegram was
sent to the War Office at Sofia, asking for reinforcements,
after which "their spirits rose to such a height that they
felt they could resist anything." On July 26 the Serbs
were again repulsed, but once more a number of sheep
and cattle were carried off. In conclusion the author
thanks "all those who morally and materially have helped
and will help the cause," including the mayors of the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>If the second Balkan War had not left memories
more bitter than at Ciprovci then the reconciling labours
of those who follow Dr. Milovanovi&#263; would be less difficult.
In our own day Mr. Leland Buxton, working also for
this union which eventually must come, suggests in his
<i>Black Sheep of the Balkans</i><a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> that Macedonia should be
made autonomous. But this would do no more than
perpetuate the wearisome and fierce intrigues of which
exponents can be always found in Balkan countries.
Macedonia must become the common possession; and
what could be more desirable than that one of these
countries should administer the province in such a way
as to attract the other country? Marshal Mi&#353;i&#263; was
of opinion that the officials whom the Serbs, after the
Balkan War, placed in Macedonia were too often not
the kind of men whom wisdom would have chosen; but
there was as yet a general eagerness to avoid being sent
to those unalluring parts. The officials left behind them
such unhappy recollections that the Serbian army, advancing
through Macedonia in 1918, was received, as
a rule, with something less than delight. Fortunately
the Yugoslav Government was able, after these events, to
induce a far superior class of officials to serve in Macedonia,
though I believe the scale of remuneration is no higher
than in the old kingdom. Men are selected who, in addition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to other qualities, speak the Turkish or Albanian of the
district. "You can count on our moral and material
support, on all that we now give to Turkey," said Mr.
Balfour in 1903 to M. Svetislav Simi&#263;, the Serbian Minister
of Foreign Affairs, who came as special envoy to London
"if," said Mr. Balfour, "you can come to an understanding
with the Bulgars on the one side and the Croats
on the other." In many Macedonian places one finds
that priests and schoolmasters&mdash;I have said this before
but it will bear repetition&mdash;who officiated under the
Bulgars have been confirmed in their posts. How very
different is this from the policy of a few years ago when,
for example, at Kriva (or Egri) Palanka there was considerable
propaganda with respect to the school. While
Macedonia was part of the Sultan's dominions there was,
on the whole, more willingness of Serbs and Bulgars to
provide a school than of the local population to frequent it.</p>


<p class="section">FEROCITIES OF EDUCATION</p>

<p>A report of February 1901 says that in Rankovci
three pupils came to the teacher's house; in April of the
same year the attendance has been reduced to one pupil,
who after coming regularly for a month decided to keep
away. In 1906 the peasants of that locality prevented
a school from being opened. At Kriva Palanka until
the Balkan War the teachers came from Kustendil&mdash;but
how far they were patronized I do not know. The three
teachers from Serbia who appeared in 1909 seem to have
spent their time in promenading the village. Not until
after the Balkan War did pupils resort to them. In 1916
the same school taught Bulgarian. In 1918 the Serbian
language was resumed. These changes were unfortunate
for the child and still more so for the teachers, who were
continually being chased away or hanged. And now at
last one finds the Serbs so much in advance of what they
and the Bulgars used to practise. Their ex-Bulgarian
schoolmasters are mostly of Macedonian origin, so that
it is not difficult for these gentlemen to give their instruction
in the kindred Serbian language, using, of course, the
local dialect. And we can look back with a smile to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
not very distant days when a zealous Serbian schoolmaster
in Macedonia was wont, instead of prayers, to make the
children repeat after him three times, every morning and
every afternoon, "Ja sam pravo Serbin" ("I am a true
Serb"). Likewise the Bulgar was so certain of the
superiority of his religion that he deprived the Pomaks
of their Moslem names, giving them for Abdulla such a
name as Anastasius. The Pomak, unable to remember
his new name, was handed a sheet of paper with a record
of the matter; but very few of these people can read.</p>


<p class="section">THE STORM IS PAST</p>

<p>Gone for ever are the days of the Turkish censor
when Danov, who sold at Veles and Salonica the schoolbooks
which at first he wrote himself, was obliged to leave
the name of Pushkin out of an anthology because of its
resemblance to pushka, a gun. And, with their more
civilized methods towards each other, we may be sure
that the days have gone when a Serb at Kumanovo could
compel Moslem children, before uttering the above-mentioned
slogan, to cross themselves; while no Serbian
bishop will find himself confronted with such a problem
as that which in 1913 nonplussed the Bishop of Skoplje&mdash;certain
Moslems had been, against their will, converted
by the Bulgars to Christianity and they now requested
the Bishop to undo what had been done. These days of
religious intolerance are as distant as those medi&aelig;val
ones in Bohemia when Roman Catholic nobles, many of
them foreigners, succeeded after the Battle of the White
Mountain to the estates of the decapitated Protestants
and conducted themselves after the fashion of one Huerta,
an ennobled tailor of Spanish origin, who drove the peasants
of his district to Mass with the help of savage dogs....
In view of the strides which have been made in so short
a time we shall have in Macedonia an example for the
other Yugoslav lands. No longer then will anyone complain
like that old couple at Ni&#353; who, on the arrival of
the Bulgarian army in the winter of 1915-1916, announced
that they were Bulgars. "But what can you do with
our daughter?" they asked, "for she says resolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that she is a Serb, since she has been to the Serbian school."
Both the Serbian and the Bulgarian people have, in the
last twenty or thirty years, been through the severest
school. Now, after an appropriate interval&mdash;some
authorities say five and some say a hundred years&mdash;they
will be fellow-citizens in Yugoslavia. The last serious
conflict between them, which we will consider in the next
chapter, has been waged.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> Of the three millions, which is estimated to have been the population
of Macedonia at the time of the Great War, almost two millions were
Slav, and it is to these only that we refer in using the term "Macedonians"
in this chapter. Among the other inhabitants of the variegated province
are Greeks and Turks and Circassians, Albanians (Tosks and Ghegs),
Jews whose ancestors came from Spain, gipsies and Kutzo-Vlachs. A
French observer said some years ago that Macedonia was a school of
brigandage and ethnology. He said it was the prey of the Albanians
and the professors&mdash;that is, of unconscionable savages and of laborious
agents of all kinds of foreign propaganda. Even the Kutzo-Vlachs,
which in Greek signifies "Limping Roumanians," made their propaganda,
or had it made for them. Gustav Weigand, a German professor who
devoted himself very thoroughly to this people, used to wish us to believe
that the Aromunes, as the Roumanians of the kingdom call their Macedonian
relatives&mdash;another name to which they answer is Tsintsares&mdash;are
free from all Greek blood. But this is not the case; they have
become very hellenized, although it is true that there are some who
call themselves Greek and who, besides having no such mixture in
their veins, cannot speak a word of the Greek language. According
to circumstances&mdash;and very much like the Serbo-Bulgarian Macedonians&mdash;this
people, who number less than 100,000, have been accustomed
to proclaim themselves now Greek and now Roumanian. They are a
good example of the bad effects of propaganda, and this, added to the
Turkish domination and the perpetual exodus of those who could manage
to escape, has left in Macedonia a population that is generally more
unsympathetic than any other in the Balkans. One may wonder, by
the way, why the Roumanians should have put themselves to so much
trouble with respect to these more or less hellenized kinsmen of theirs,
not merely giving them direct support, but subsidizing Weigand's institution
at Leipzig. A great reason was that King Charles, the friend of the
German and Austro-Hungarian Empires, aimed at diverting the eyes of
his statesmen from the unredeemed Roumanians in Transylvania.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> But Macedonia is not the only part of Yugoslavia where a man's
nationality varies. One Rejuka, for example, came to Ver&#353;ac in the
Banat. He was a Czech, but as at that period (1850-1860) everything
German predominated, he preferred to be a German and sent his son to
German schools. Then the boy learned Magyar at college and, long before
he was appointed mayor, had become a Magyar. Thus we have three
nationalities in two generations.</p></div>

of the travels this involved is interesting. But even her account of relief
work is biased by a prejudice in favour of the Albanians and against
the Slavs, for when she has occasion to speak of the famous Miss Irby,
whose thirty years of untiring benevolence were spent among the Serbs
of Bosnia and not among the Albanians, it is without a word of commendation.</p></div>

Austrian archives. It is a lengthy report sent from Cetinje on November
1, 1911, by Baron Giesl, the Austrian Minister, to Count Aerenthal, the
minister of Foreign Affairs. Giesl puts down very vividly a conversation
he has had with Nikita, who suggested that the Minister should go forthwith
to Vienna with the purpose of preparing for a secret treaty. "I
will do all that Austria desires," the King is reported to have said; "for
instance, I will place under her protection the kingdom of Montenegro....
For years I have aimed at this and, in spite of all that has happened [the
annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina], I was preparing my people for this
and putting Austria in a sympathetic light." The King promised that his
army (whose numbers, says Giesl, he multiplied by two in this conversation)
should act in perfect harmony with Austria's troops&mdash;they would,
if need arose, assist each other. Baron Giesl appears to have irritated
Nikita by his lack of enthusiasm for the scheme. "With Austria-Hungary,
the King had said, "I must be frank and honest." But the Minister
characterized his efforts as the throwing of dust in Austria's eyes.</p></div>

<p class="section">HOW THE AUSTRIANS WAGED WAR</p>

<p>"Machen Sie Ordnung!" ["Put matters in order"]
was the phrase used by Austrian officers in Serbia when
they wished a non-commissioned officer to see that such
and such Serbian civilians should be hanged or shot.
Occasionally an accident occurred, as when a priest near
Vi&#353;egrad came to an officer with the request that his
plum trees should be spared, since he had nothing else.
This officer intended to be kind and, not knowing or forgetting
the sense in which those three words were being
used, he said to a sergeant, "Machen Sie Ordnung!" and
the next morning a prominent citizen of Split, Count
Pavlovi&#263;, whose post in the Austro-Hungarian army was
that of a provost-marshal, saw the priest, his wife and
his three little boys hanging from the plum trees. It
was and is the fashion to assert that the Austrian army
was incomparably less brutal than the Prussian, so that
some readers will be disinclined to believe a conversation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
which Count Pavlovi&#263;, particularly as he is a Yugoslav,
once had at Donja Tusla in Bosnia with a certain Captain
Waldstein, who between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. had sentenced
nineteen people to be hanged. These people, by the
way, were all over twenty years of age, so that each case
had to be tried; persons under that age could, as we
have seen, also be hanged, but not as the result of a trial.
Pavlovi&#263; approached the captain&mdash;his rank, to be accurate,
was captain-auditor&mdash;and asked him how he had lunched
after such a morning's work. "I felt," was the reply,
"as if I had drunk nineteen glasses of beer." An Austrian
army surgeon, Dr. Wallisch, who during the occupation
travelled professionally in Serbia and wrote a good deal
about it in Viennese papers and Austrian papers in Belgrade,
said that "everywhere in this Balkan and patriarchal
environment you see educational mansions and
spacious barracks.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Does not this, better than anything
else, show the criminal, premeditated hostility of the
Serbs against our Monarchy? They have the longing
to learn, which devours the ambitious, and likewise the
wish to realise by force of arms this fantastic ideal of an
over-excited national sentiment." Yes indeed, this was
the ideal of King Peter, in accordance with the device of
the poet, Aksentie Teodosijevi&#263;: "Towards liberty, in
the first place through learning and culture, then with
arms." Very few people would be inclined to believe
that the invading Austrians could be so petty as to burn
all the schoolbooks they came across, and still fewer
would credit the fact that Yugoslav patients with gold-filled
teeth ran any special risk in Austrian army hospitals.
Ivo Stani&#353;i&#263; of the Bocche di Cattaro had fought with the
Montenegrins and, in consequence of Nikita's capitulation,
had fallen into the Austrians' hands. He was
warned by his friends not to go into hospital, where his
twelve gold teeth, which he had acquired in the United
States, might prove his undoing. He did, as a matter
of fact, die there, and the overdose of morphia&mdash;witnessed
by the well-known architect, Matejorski of Prague&mdash;may
have been accidental, and the Austrians who took his
teeth out may have thought it foolish to leave so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
gold in a corpse. Another Bocchesi who underwent the
same treatment was one Risto Lije&#353;evi&#263;. Perhaps the
Austrians do not deny these incidents, and considering the
trouble which they gave themselves to have a long series
of open-air brutalities officially photographed and made
the subject of picture postcards, one presumes that the
dental operations were omitted on account of the bother
of indoor photography. The postcards, of which I have
a large collection, place on record the procedure used in
the wholesale hanging and shooting of Bosnian and
Serbian civilians, young and old, men and women. More
trouble was taken over the photographs, which are
sometimes minute and sometimes artistic in depicting a
row of gallows on an eminence with gloomy clouds behind
them, than was taken with the manufacture of these
gallows, for in many cases they were no more than a seven-foot
stake, to the top of which the victim's throat was
firmly fastened, holding his or her feet a short distance
from the ground. We have in the London Press and in
the House of Lords a number of reactionary persons who
do not cease regretting the disappearance of Austria-Hungary.
The new States, such as Yugoslavia and
Czecho-Slovakia, they argue, are very unsatisfactory, if
only for the reason that they substitute a lower civilization
for a higher. Austrian culture, in their opinion, is
so different from that of the new States that you cannot
compare them. And when they talk of the Habsburg
dynasty it is after the fashion of old Francis Joseph who,
in 1891, when the four hundredth anniversary of the great
Czech teacher Comenius was being officially celebrated
in all the schools of Prussia, commanded that nothing of
the sort was to be done in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy,
because his attention had been drawn by Archbishop
Schwarzenberg of Prague to a Latin letter in which the
great man uttered some sharp words concerning the
dynasty. One is prepared to overlook a great many
things which happened in the stress of war, but the postcards
which portray fashionably dressed women and girls
strolling between the gallows as if at a garden party and
merely using their parasols against the sun, do not appear
to leave any attributes for a civilization lower than that
which they exhibit. The Bosniaks and Serbs who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
thus done away with were frequently even less to blame
than those ignorant peasants who, being told by their
priests that Peter was their King, shouted "Long live
King Peter!" as the Austrian troops marched through
their villages, and were forthwith hanged for high treason.
"Whenever," says Euripides, "I see the wicked fall
into adversity I declare that the gods do exist." At
Trnovo twenty-eight were executed, including two women
and at Pal&eacute;, near Sarajevo, twenty-six, the Austrians
killing all the old folk and the children who remained
when the Montenegrin and Serbian armies retreated.
Those who were not murdered on the spot had a period
of imprisonment during which they were fed on white
bread; but all that they were asked, prior to their execution,
was their name, their father's name and their domicile.
Thousands were interned&mdash;at Doboj between twenty and
thirty died every day of illness or of famine. The fate
of the abandoned children in Bosnia was such that when
Dr. Bilinski, the Governor (afterwards Minister of Finance
in Poland) was told of it he had the decency to weep.
His informant was Madame &#262;uk of Zagreb, so well known
to British travellers; this lady was at the head of an
organization which removed as many children as possible
from Bosnia to other parts of the Dual Monarchy. The
diet of grass, cow's dung and a kind of bread, chiefly
composed of clay and wood-shavings and the bark of
trees, gave to nearly all the children a protruding stomach;
they were so weak that they would fall out of the luggage-racks
of the railway carriages, and with 500-600 children
in three waggons it was necessary to deposit some of
them in the racks. At a place called Sunia it was the
ladies' custom to have cauldrons of maize and water,
as well as bacon, waiting for the travellers, but very
often this food brought on a colic, so unaccustomed were
the children to fats.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> If the Austrians intended to put
their Bosnian house in order by finishing off the population&mdash;"Machen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>Sie Ordnung"&mdash;they made considerable
progress. They had hoped, before the War began, to
send a punitive expedition into Serbia that would finish
off that insolent, small country. Delirious was the
enthusiasm of the Viennese at the declaration of War.
Fate was giving them the whitest of bread before their
execution.</p>

<p>The Austrian statesmen did not embark on the War
without taking certain precautions. Count Berchtold,
on July 28, submitted for the old Emperor's signature the
war declaration, which explicitly stated that the Government
was forced to protect its rights and interests by
recourse to arms, the more so as the Serbian troops had
already attacked the Imperial and Royal soldiers at
Temes-Kubin on the Danube. After the Emperor had
signed the declaration of war in this form, Count Berchtold
struck out the reference to a fight at Temes-Kubin,
and sent a letter to Francis Joseph explaining that he
had taken it on himself to eliminate this sentence as the
reports had not been confirmed. "It is clear," said the
<ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Arbeiter Zeitung'"><i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i></ins>,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> commenting on the Austrian Red-book
which revealed this affair, "it is clear that the fight at
Temes-Kubin never occurred, but was simply invented
by Count Berchtold. That arch-scoundrel not only
deceived the people, but also the Emperor. The destiny
of the world depended upon whether an eighty-four-year-old
man permitted himself to be deceived. For such a
crime Berchtold must certainly be sent to prison, or, more
justly, to the gallows."</p>

<p>If the punitive expedition into Serbia had been less
disastrous, it would perhaps have been accompanied with
less barbarity&mdash;though the Austrian army was handicapped,
owing to the large number of aristocratic, and
presumably more gentle, officers who found themselves
unable to leave the War Office and similar institutions in
Vienna. Yet the Austrians seem to have determined how
to act before they came. A special branch of the army
occupied itself with the stealing, packing and dispatching
of cameras, engravings, ladies' garments, etc. etc.&mdash;numerous
lists were accidentally left behind in Belgrade,
and every sheet at the top left-hand corner was stamped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
with the words "Sammlungs-Offizier" (<i>i.e.</i> Collection-officer).
I do not know what knowledge and what skill
are necessary before this rubber stamp is conferred upon
a man. Did the Imperial and Royal authorities regard
him as a non-combatant? The "Sammlungs-Offizier"
might resent such a classification if in private life he had
been a courageous burglar. And the Imperial and Royal
army, according to certain "Instructions for the conduct
of troops" which were found on a wounded officer of the
9th Army Corps, had resolved&mdash;irrespective of success
or failure in the War&mdash;to massacre the Serbs without
compunction: "Any person encountered in the open,
and especially in a forest, must be regarded as a member
of a 'band' that has concealed its weapons somewhere,
which weapons we have not the time to look for. These
people are to be executed if they appear even slightly
suspicious"; and another paragraph says that "I will
not allow persons armed, but wearing no uniform, whether
encountered singly or in groups, to be taken prisoners.
They must be executed without exception." The
Austrians knew very well that the Serbs had not received
their new uniforms, and that at least one-third of their
army was obliged to take the field in ordinary peasant's
dress.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The fact that the Austrian invasion of north-western
Serbia came to such an ignominious end before
September is no reason why so large a number of women,
children and old men were, as is very well authenticated,
cut to pieces, burned alive, despoiled of their eyes, their
noses, disembowelled, and so forth. One expects a certain
amount of licence from the baser elements of an
invading army; but in Serbia&mdash;perhaps because this was
a punitive expedition&mdash;it seems to have been the Imperial
and Royal officers who egged on their men.... I have
tried, from the Austrian records, to ascertain whether
any comparable outrages can be laid at the door of the
Serbs. And there is one incident which utterly disgraces
some of their Montenegrin brothers: the men of Fo&#269;a
in Herzegovina joined the Montenegrin army when it
penetrated to the neighbourhood of Sarajevo. When it
was thrown back the Fo&#269;a comrades&mdash;Yugoslavs, of course,
and guilty of high treason against Austria&mdash;accompanied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
them to Montenegro; and later on some Montenegrin
officers denounced the people of Fo&#269;a to the Austrians,
with the result that fourteen of them were hanged.</p>

<p>On August 24, 1914, after twelve terrible days, the
Austrians were dislodged from &#352;abac and flung across to
the northern bank of the Save. More useful to the Serbs
than their 6000 prisoners were the 50 cannons and over
30,000 rifles, for the Serbian troops had entered the
War with such scanty equipment that many of the regiments
with an effective strength of over 4000 men possessed
only 2500 rifles. The armed soldiers went into action,
while the unarmed waited in reserve, springing forward
as their comrades fell, and taking up the weapons of the
fallen to continue the fight. Here occurred an incident
of which the hero was a boy. He had run away to the
army and, to his vast delight, been made a standard-bearer.
When an officer perceived that he was continuously
exposing himself he told him to hide. "No
one will see you," said the officer. "But," answered the
boy, "the flag will see." And he was killed. Many of
the dead or wounded Austrians were Southern Slavs who
had not been able to surrender to their brothers; they
were often found with all their cartridges intact, and with
their rifles made incapable of shooting.</p>


<p class="section">THE SERBIAN PRINCES</p>

<p>One of the first results of this victory was the invasion,
by Serb and Montenegrin troops, of Bosnia. They succeeded
in penetrating to within a few miles of Sarajevo,
and there they were held up not only by the encircling
forts but by the scarcity of their ammunition, for the
Russian supplies had not yet come through. "Your
Royal Highness," said a corporal one day to Prince
George, the impetuous young man who had resigned his
position as heir to the throne and was at this moment far
more congenially occupied as the chief of an irregular
band in the mountains, "we have no more ammunition,"
said the corporal. "Each man has a knife?" asked
George. The corporal nodded. "Then let us go on."
The Prince has a great wound across his breast, from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
side to the other. He is very much the descendant of
Kara George; he dislikes making a secret of his opinions.
King Peter, who was present at the inauguration of the
Belgrade synagogue, always refrained from entering the
Roman Catholic Church, since it was included in the
buildings of the Austrian Legation. His elder son was
not averse, when relations were strained, from taking an
enthusiastic part in anti-Austrian demonstrations, so that
the Austrians were delighted to spread a report that this
ebullient youth had killed his orderly and must be set
aside from the succession. The truth was that George
happened to catch this orderly reading a private letter of
his; in a sudden fit of rage he struck him a blow, even as
Kara George would have done&mdash;unluckily the man rolled
down some steps and from the resulting injuries he died.
A good many Austrian and German writers have said
that George is mad; he is certainly less fitted to govern
Yugoslavia than is Alexander, his brother. One remembers
George, so dark and lean and hawk-eyed, traversing the
broad Danube at Belgrade in a most original fashion; as
the blocks of ice swept along he made his horse leap from
one of them to another. And one thinks of that more
patient prince, Alexander, poring for hours over papers
of State, gazing up a little wearily through his glasses,
wondering for month after month whether the crisis
between Government and Opposition in Yugoslavia will
ever be solved. George will seek relaxation in driving a
motor-car as if the Serbian roads were a racing track;
Alexander's relaxation is to hear a new musical play,
then to go home and repeat the whole score by heart on
his piano.</p>

<p>All through the War Alexander, the Prince Regent&mdash;for
King Peter felt himself, on account of his age and his
rheumatism, unequal to anything save the personal encouragement
of his soldiers in the trenches<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>&mdash;throughout
the War Alexander was with his army. In his eloquent
proclamations one sees the student; on the battlefield<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
he conquered his shyness. And now he is a truly democratic
King, at whose table very often is some non-commissioned
officer or private whose acquaintance he has
made in the War. He asked the man to come and see
him one day in Belgrade, so that the royal adjutants are
always busy with this stream of warriors. The men are
well aware that their own peasant costume, with the
sandals, is admissible at Court&mdash;even at a ball you see
some fine old peasant, who is perhaps a deputy (and who
does not, like a certain Polish Minister of recent years,
remove his white collar before entering the Chamber).
You can see him in his thick brown homespun with black
braiding, breeches very baggy at the seat and closely
fitting round the legs; as he comes in he knocks the snow
from off his sandals, and strides, perfectly at ease, across
the Turkish carpets. With such a man the King loves
greatly to go hunting; last winter in the Rudnik region
the inhabitants were being plagued by wolves, so the King
went down there with some officers and peasants. Though
he is so short-sighted that he constantly wears glasses&mdash;if
you met him casually you would suppose that this keen-faced
young officer was probably a writer of military books&mdash;though
he is short-sighted he is one of the best shots in
Europe. On the Slovenian mountains he has brought
down many chamois and, before he succeeded, at a summer
resort in Serbia he was always first at target practice.
Nor is he less skilled at cards, particularly bridge. He
gathers round him the best players in the town. Such
are his relaxations after the long round of audiences and
hours of other work. During the day he will have very
likely undertaken to pay the expenses from his own pocket
of another Serbian student, at home or abroad. So many
of them are his pensioners. And it may be said without
flattery that in the pursuit of knowledge he affords them
an example. His subjects number about 14 millions,
but when in conversation I happened to allude to a remote
border village, his subsequent remarks made me
wonder whether he had just been reading an article
about the chequered history of that little place. He is,
in fact, like his late grandfather of Montenegro, the father
of his people. But they have different ideas about the
duties of a father; and while Nikita's laugh was pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
grim, the deep whole-hearted laugh of Alexander takes
you into the sincere recesses of the man.</p>

<p>During the Bosnian offensive there was launched an
expedition over the Save into the goodly land of Syrmia,
one of those Yugoslav provinces of which the Austro-Hungarian
Empire was to be stripped. This expedition
had a varying success, for the assault that was attempted
in the neighbourhood of Mitrovica was not skilfully
conducted; and the Serbian army, for the first time in
the War, was worsted. Then troops in Bosnia, just before
the grand attack on Sarajevo, were thrown into confusion
by an order from the Montenegrin King who, without
vouching any reason, called his army back. The Serbian
troops had no other course than to retreat as well; and
their enemies delivered, all the rest of September and
throughout October, a tremendous thrust against the
army that was shielding Valjevo. The Serbs, who were
lamentably short of arms, munition, clothing and every
sort of hospital equipment, did not care to think of the
approach of winter. They hurled themselves against the
Austrian swarms&mdash;and up to this period they had lost,
in dead and seriously wounded, more than 130,000 men.</p>


<p class="section">THE TACTICS OF THE MONTENEGRIN KING</p>

<p>The co-operation between Serbs and Montenegrins for
the Bosnian campaign was the occasion of some of Nikita's
usual devious diplomacy. He summoned, as we have seen,
a superfluous Skup&#353;tina, whose resolutions would enable
him to go to Francis Joseph, his secret ally, with a tale of
<i>force majeure</i>. And he telegraphed to his grandson, the
Serbian Prince-Regent: "My Montenegrins and myself
are already on the frontiers, ready to die in the defence
of our national independence." While his ill-equipped
warriors pushed on to Budva, arrived before Kotor,
seized Fo&#269;a, Rogatica and other towns, pressing on until
they stood before the forts of Sarajevo, the disreputable
Royal Family, jealous as ever of Belgrade, were plunging
deeper and always deeper into treachery. The Serbian
officers, General Jankovi&#263; and Colonel (now General)
Pe&#353;i&#263;, who, mainly at the instance of Russia, had been sent
to reorganize the Montenegrin army, saw themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
hampered at every turn by the Court clique at Cetinje.
Jankovi&#263;, finding that orders were given without his knowledge,
returned to Ni&#353;; and later on, after the fall of
Lov&#269;en, Nikita tried to foist upon Pe&#353;i&#263; the odium of a
surrender which his own machinations had brought about.</p>


<p class="section">THE MAGYARS AND THEIR PRISONERS</p>

<p>As one might have expected, the withdrawal from
Bosnia was followed by a repetition of the reign of terror
in that beautiful land of woods and villages, where the
Imperial and Royal authorities had been engaged for years
in showing foreign journalists exactly what they wanted
them to see. There had been some doubt as to whether
Bosnia-Herzegovina came under the crown of Austria or
that of Hungary. The Magyars had been gradually
getting the upper hand in the administration, and now, in
the autumn of 1914, it was they who undertook to deal
with those subjected Bosniaks. Again we are furnished
with evidence galore, not this time by picture postcards
but by the cemeteries at Arad, the Hungarian (now
it is a Roumanian) town on the Maro&#353;. It was in the casemates
of the Arad fortress, many of which had not been
opened from the days of Maria Theresa, that thousands
of poor Bosniak civilians were interned. In one of the
cemeteries I counted 2103 black wooden crosses, in another
between 600 and 700, in another about a thousand. These
dead witnesses are more eloquent than the living. "On
October 31, 1915," says an inscription on a cross in the
largest cemetery, "there died, aged 95, Milija Arzi&#263;."
She may have been a fearful danger to the Magyar State.
Cross No. 716 says merely "Deaf and Dumb," so does
No. 774. Jovan Kruni&#263;, No. 706, was 1&frac12; year old.
There are children even younger. The Magyars seem to
have applied to Bosnia that label which the monkish
medi&aelig;val map-makers applied to the remoter peoples:
"Here dwell very evil men." If, however, the commandant,
Lieut.-Colonel Heged&uuml;s&mdash;a magyarized version of
the German <i>held</i>, which means "hero"&mdash;and his subordinates,
Sergeants Rosner and Herzfeld, would claim
that they did their best, they have some excuse in the fact
that although the 10,000 interned people began to arrive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
in July, the first two doctors&mdash;who were also captives&mdash;did
not appear until January 1915. In the absence of
medical advice the sergeants may have thought it was an
excellent plan, in November, to drive the prisoners into
the Maro&#353; for a bath and then to walk them up and down
the bank until their clothes were dry; Heged&uuml;s may have
thought it was most sanitary to have dogs to eat the
corpses' entrails and sometimes the whole corpse. Dr.
Stephen Pop, a Roumanian lawyer in Arad (afterwards a
Minister at Bucharest), displayed his humanity by drawing
up a terrible indictment of the conditions. "You should
be glad," said Tisza, the reactionary Premier, to him,
"very glad that you can breathe the free air of Hungary."
The casemates were provided with less than three centimetres
of straw, which was not removed for months.
Spotted fever, pneumonia and enteritis were the chief
epidemics: those who were guilty of some offence, such
as receiving a newspaper, would be put among the
spotted fever cases. Sometimes the dead were left for
two or three days with the living. Such was the state of the
bastions and their underground passages that the Magyar
soldiers came as rarely as they could manage. It was, said
Heged&uuml;s, a provisional arrangement to have about a
thousand people in one of these passages or lunettes, with
no lavatory. But it was not only the <ins class="correction"
title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'nonagenaraians'">nonagenarians</ins>&mdash;several
of whom were at Arad&mdash;that found their life was a
very provisional affair. You could be killed in different
ways: the dying were occasionally wrapped in a sheet
and rocked against a wall. When they groaned the
soldiers laughed, and said that this was "Cheering King
Peter." In fact the Magyars behaved with rare generosity
to their prisoners, we are told in the <i>Oxford Hungarian
Review</i> (June 1922), by Mr. Aubrey Herbert, M.P., a
gentleman who persists in writing of that which he does
not know. A woman called Lenka (or Helen) Mihailovi&#263;,
who had kept the canteen in the fortress during fifteen
years, was expelled in January 1916 for having helped to
clothe some naked children. People used to give Rosner,
the sergeant, a tip in order to be allowed to visit the canteen.
Their ordinary food was the reverse of appetizing.
Constantine, the son of Ilja Jovanovi&#263;, a boy who used to
be employed at the fortress (and who had not been permitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
by the Magyars to learn his own language), saw the
children being fed, very often, on salt fish&mdash;no matter
whether they were ill or not&mdash;and sometimes on the intestines
of horses. The Serbian grave-diggers used to
cook themselves a dish of grass, salt and water. They were
too weak to work, and they had work enough: on
February 1, 1915, for instance, twenty-nine people were
buried. A certain captain (afterwards Major) Lachmann,
an Austrian officer, arrived in Arad and heard the apprehensions
that an epidemic might spread from the fortress.
This had, in fact, been debated by the town council; and
Lachmann was eventually responsible for a commission
of inquiry. But Heged&uuml;s, although he was degraded and
condemned to prison, made a successful appeal, for his
father-in-law was a field-marshal, one Pacor.</p>

<p>A few improvements were made in the casemates
towards the end of 1917, as a Spanish commission was
expected. But it never came. Some of the long galleries
have, since the Armistice, been furnished with
windows and electric light; but about four months after
the Armistice I found them full of dead flies and heavy
with an abominable stench. Amid the d&eacute;bris were many
lamps, such as one uses in a mine. There was a proclamation,
dated 1918, which tried to lure deserters back; it
promised that no punishment would be inflicted on them
if they should return, but that robbery or murder would
meet with capital punishment, either by shooting or by
strangling. The floor was littered with all kinds of paper,
with scraps of furniture, a few chains and some prison
books, which dated back for years. These gave details
of all the punishments and were written in a very ornamental
script, as though the clerks had taken a pleasure
in their work. The Arad fortress had been partly used as
a prison for a long time; but Misko Tatar, a Magyar, who
stayed there sixteen years for having murdered his
fianc&eacute;e, his mother and his sister, as well as one Kocian,
who remained for more than eighteen years&mdash;he had
murdered the proprietor of a canteen, his wife and child in
the Bocche&mdash;and Rujitatzka, a Croat, who together with
another man had been accused of theft, had killed their
escort and thrown his body into the Danube&mdash;none of
these culprits could remember having heard of such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
punishments as the Bosniak civilians had to bear. The
iron ring from which people used to be suspended for a
couple of hours could still be seen on a large tree. If the
relatives or friends could pay a fine this penalty was discontinued.
Another method was to fasten a man's right
wrist to his left ankle and the left wrist to the right ankle.
He would then be left for a week; every night a blanket
was thrown over him. But there is something very
strange in the composition of the Magyars. When the
revolution broke out and the prisoners, after all the years
of horror, were gaining their freedom, an acquaintance
of mine, a certain Gavri&#263;, whose job for three and a half
years had been the comparatively pleasant one of cleaning
boots, was on the point of leaving the prison. There he
was met by the director's daughter. "And you an
intelligent person!" she said. "Are you not ashamed
of yourself?" The Hungarian newspapers wrote that
Heged&uuml;s was dead, which may or may not have been true;
and in another paper, <i>The Hungarian Nation</i>, printed in
English, in February 1920, the Rev. Dr. Nally said:
"May we not still cling to the hope that chivalrous England
will give a helping hand to the nation whose weakness
is that she is too chivalrous?" One Englishman&mdash;whom
the reader may or may not consider worth quoting&mdash;is
with the Magyars. "No country," says Lord Newton,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
"treated their prisoners of war so well as the Hungarian,
and I know it, because looking after prisoners of war was
my job." "My husband," says Lady Newton,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> "had
interested himself in their cause"&mdash;of "this delightful
race," she terms them in the previous sentence&mdash;"and had
been able to do their country some slight service, and for
this they simply could not sufficiently show their gratitude
towards ourselves. From the prince to the peasant
the Hungarian is a <i>grand seigneur</i>, with all the instincts of a
great gentleman and the manners of a king." May I
mention that at the same time, I believe, as Lord and Lady
Newton were being entertained, a poor Slovak was being
differently treated. Having left his home in Hungary to
serve in the Czecho-Slovak army, and having settled
in Czecho-Slovakia, after the War he got word that his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>mother was dying. He thereupon applied for and received
a Hungarian visa, and on entering that territory he was
arrested! A long time afterwards the Czecho-Slovak
Legation at Buda-Pest was vainly trying to have him
liberated.</p>

circulating false reports, not only with reference to "the

also as to the attitude of neutral States and of our own
tried and excellent commanders, who are said to "have
practised treachery, followed by suicide." The Ban's
attention is directed to the introduction of hostile newspapers,
and he is asked to have the foreign consuls in
Zagreb discreetly watched. He is also told that in
Zagreb the bank officials are said to have discouraged
the citizens from investing in war loans.]</p>

<p>[This is a long and conscientious expos&eacute; by the military
commandant of Zagreb of the political situation there
and in Croatia generally. He mentions that when in
June 1913 several men deserted from the 4th company
of the 53rd Infantry Battalion, which belonged to the
8th Mountain Brigade, it was not thought to have any
special significance. "When," says the writer, "I
happened to express my astonishment that Croats should
desert to Serbia, I received the following answer: 'The
Croats are loyal, but the Emperor does not care for us;
the Magyars do not understand us and we also do not
wish to become Magyars. Therefore the Croats turn to
the Serbs, who at least understand their language.'
At that time," he continues, "I did not understand
these words, but now that I have become more acquainted
with this country, I see that they reveal everything.
Alas, so many Croats have adopted this popular logic and
seem to incline to the Serbs."</p>

<p>He explains that harmonious relations did not exist
between the military command and the local government,
since the former acted without taking into account the
political position of any individual, while the latter acted
in the reverse fashion.]</p>


<p class="section">HOW THE WAR RAGED IN THE WINTER OF 1914-1915</p>

<p>In the winter of 1914 the Serbian army had been
obliged to withdraw, leaving Valjevo to the Austrians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
The retrograde movement had to continue; Belgrade was
abandoned at the end of November, and the people
from those northern and western parts of the country
could not resign themselves to waiting for the enemy,
after the manner in which he had behaved. Terror-stricken
fugitives began to block the roads and to impede
the movements of the army. Everywhere was panic.
It is remarkable that the Serbian Government at Ni&#353;
chose this time (November 24) for making to the National
Skup&#353;tina the first Declaration<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> that they proposed to
carry on the War until "we have delivered and united
all our brothers who are not yet free, Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes." (Later on when old King Peter after many
trials managed to reach Durazzo he was given a few hours'
notice in which to leave that place; he was also thrust
out of Brindisi by the Italians because he declined to
repudiate this Declaration.) "Machen Sie Ordnung"
would soon be heard. Even the army, unaccustomed to
defeat, was losing its self-possession. Putnik, the revered
old strategist, declared that he could do no more. No
longer in his over-heated room, struggling with asthma,
could the famous marshal evolve a plan. And then it
happened that General Mi&#353;i&#263;, placed in command of the
first army, determined, after studying the situation, to
risk everything on a last throw. Mi&#353;i&#263; was a quiet, methodical
little man, whose optimism was always based on knowledge&mdash;in
the intervals between Serbia's former campaigns
he had won distinction as Professor of Strategy. He
now caused 1400 young students, the flower of the nation,
to be appointed non-commissioned officers; he likewise
produced a most brilliant scheme of operations, so that
the whole army was fired with enthusiasm, and so irresistibly
did they attack that by December 13 not a single
armed Austrian remained in the country. Ernest
Haeckel, the great professor, had said at Jena that the
native superiority of the German nation conferred on
them the right to occupy the Balkans, Asia Minor, Syria
and Mesopotamia, excluding from these parts the weaker
and inferior peoples who were living there. On December
15 King Peter made a triumphal entry into Belgrade&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Hungarian flag which had floated from the Palace was
employed as a carpet on the steps of the cathedral when
the King proceeded thither with his generals to give
thanks for the miraculous success of Serbia's army.
Once more the famous little town, the "white town" that
is throned so splendidly above the plain where two wide
rivers meet, was in possession of the Serbs. Against this
rampart many human waves have broken&mdash;Attila and
his Huns encamped on the plain, the Ostrogoths appeared,
Justinian built the city walls, then came the Avars and
Charlemagne and the Franks, the Bulgars, the Byzantines,
the Magyars. The white town, Beli Grad or Beograd,
which we call Belgrade&mdash;Wizzenburch was the old
German name&mdash;has a glorious past and surely a magnificent
future.</p>

<p>When the Serbs came back to Belgrade in December
1914, the total of Austrian prisoners was more numerous
than the Serbian combatants. But 35,000 of these
prisoners, together with 250,000 Serbs of all ages and
106 Serbian and Allied doctors, were now to succumb to
the plague of typhus, which the Austrian troops had
carried from Galicia. Hospitals were hurried out from
France and Great Britain; heroic work was done by
women and by men; doctors operated day and night&mdash;in
the hospitals the patients were so closely packed that
it was impossible to step between them.</p>

<p>"In Skoplje," says Colonel Morrison, who in civil
life is senior surgeon to the Queen's Hospital, Birmingham&mdash;"in
Skoplje a British unit was installed in a large factory
accommodating over 1000 medical and surgical patients.
Besides their inherent unsuitability the premises were
detestably insanitary and the floor space overcrowded
to its utmost capacity. On the ground floor I saw 250
men lying on sacks of straw packed closely together,
covered only by their ragged uniform under a blanket.
Gangrenous limbs and septic compound fractures were
common, the stench being overpowering; yet every
window was closely shut." He tells how seven out of
the members of the British staff went down with typhus.
At U&#382;ice he found over 700 patients crammed into rooms
containing about 500 beds; many were lying on the
bare floor; others were on sacks of straw; others on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
raised wooden platforms in series of six men side by
side. Often one would see an elderly warrior, who had
been wounded a week or two previously, being jolted
along in an ox-cart with several civilians who were suffering
from typhus&mdash;all trying to find a hospital that could
take them in. And meanwhile it was necessary to reorganize
the army: all the men between the ages of
seventeen and fifty-five were called to the colours, including
those whom the doctors had declared to be totally
unfit for military service.</p>


<p class="section">THE TREATY OF LONDON, APRIL 1915</p>

<p>On April 26, 1915, the negotiations were concluded
between France, Great Britain, Russia and Italy; the
Treaty of London was signed and the Italians had become
our Allies. By this Treaty we and France and Russia
undertook to give them, if we were victorious, a very
large increase of territory&mdash;over which, by the way, we
none of us had any right of disposal.</p>

<p>["For Serbia and for Montenegro this is a war of
defence and of liberation and not of conquest," said the
Yugoslav Committee in London (May 1915)&mdash;which
Committee, by the way, made its first headquarters in
Rome, and only transferred itself to London and Paris
in view of the frankly hostile attitude of Sonnino and his
colleagues. It consisted of the prominent Croats and
Slovenes who had managed to escape across the Austrian
frontier. "Serbia and Montenegro," said the Committee,
"fight to liberate our people from a foreign yoke
and to unite them in one sole, free nation.... To perpetuate
the separation of these territories in leaving them
under the Austro-Hungarian domination or another
foreign domination, would be in flagrant violation of our
ethnographic, geographic and economic unity; our
people would, without any doubt, oppose to it an energetic
and justified resistance."] At other times during the
nineteenth century the Great Powers made amongst
themselves and without consulting the Small Powers
certain arrangements which affected the latter, although,
as Professor Westlake observes,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> all the States, so far as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
their sovereignty is concerned, stand equal before the
law. But these arbitrary arrangements had always been
made in the interest and for the security and well-being
of the weaker State, as, for example, when the Congress of
Berlin decided on the independence of Roumania and
Serbia, in accordance with the will of the people. This
beneficent action on the part of the Great Powers infringed
none of the principles of international law, whereas the
Treaty of London took away from the smaller Power
nearly everything of value it possessed and stripped it of
the possibility of future greatness; the spoil was presented
by the Great Powers to one of themselves. We may
concede, as Mr. C.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;H. Bartlett of the New York and
United States Federal Bar points out in his closely
reasoned monograph<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>&mdash;we may concede that belligerents
can by way of anticipation allot enemy land among
themselves, yet such a compact cannot properly be
exercised by them so as to work injustice to another ally
who was not a party to the division of territory. From
the first it was well understood that the Treaty of London
could only be imposed in direct defiance of the wishes of
the populations most immediately concerned, so that
the Italian Cabinet insisted that the whole transaction
should be kept from the knowledge of the Serbian Government.
As an illustration of the domineering and extortionate
nature of Italy's demands (to which the Entente
submitted) one may mention that part of the proposed
boundary was traced over the high seas beyond the three-mile
limit, which of course was a proposition entirely at
variance with international law. We should not forget,
says the <i>Spectator</i>,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> the whole Italian record of idealism
and liberal thought. And Mr. G.&nbsp;M. Trevelyan, an
Italian exponent,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> remarks that the terms of the Treaty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>of London were unknown to the people who paraded the
streets of Rome impatient for their country to enter the
War, and threatening with death the Minister Giolitti
who had hitherto succeeded in keeping them out of it.
The grandiose bargain which the Government had made
was unknown to them; but surely Mr. Trevelyan is paying
meagre tribute to their idealism and liberal thought
when he implies they would have been elated by a knowledge
of the details of the Treaty. Ought not, rather, a
people imbued with the afore-mentioned virtues to have
threatened with death a Minister who should attempt
to carry through so scandalous an instrument? "The
broad reason why the Italians joined our side," says Mr.
Trevelyan, "was because they were a Western, a Latin
and a Liberal civilization." Mr. Bartlett, who ponders
his words with legal precision, thinks that "Italy was
not inspired by any very noble principles of right and
justice when the War began, nor until long after it had
swept over the greater portion of Europe ... nor was
she spontaneously moved by any sentiment of human
justice. She was cool, calculating and business-like.
She weighed carefully in the balance the advantages and
disadvantages she might derive from the pending struggle;
she saw on which side the profit might lie, and with that
commercial prudence for which her people are renowned
she set her own price on the value of her aid to the
Entente." But if the long hesitation was nothing more
than governmental prudence, and if the nation as a whole
was out of sympathy with such ideas, how came it that,
after the plunge was taken, no less than 300 deputies
left their cards on Signor Giolitti? The country was,
through various causes, swept into the War; and in
considering whether this was in harmony with or in
opposition to the desires of the majority I think one
should pay at least as much attention to the deputies
who acted as to the crowd who shouted.... The country
was swept into the War, and a Bologna newspaper (<i>Resto
del Carlino</i>, March 21, 1915) has published a telegram
from Sonnino to the Italian Ambassadors in Paris, London
and Petrograd, which announced that Italy was joining
in the World War for the purpose of destroying the
strategical advantage enjoyed by Austria in the Adriatic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
But at the same time the Southern Slavs must be prevented
from gaining a similar position, and so the coast
must be neutralized from Kotor to the river Voju&#353;a.
Sonnino expressly gives Rieka to the Croats. It is not
only this which lends great interest to the document,
but the fact that Italy's entrance into the War was determined
five weeks before the signing of the Treaty of
London and two months before she actually declared war.</p>


<p class="section">HOW BULGARIA CAME INTO THE WAR</p>

<p>In the course of the year 1915 Ferdinand of Bulgaria,
with his henchman Radoslavoff, was arranging to come
into the War. Public opinion in that country was smarting
under the drastic Treaty of Bucharest, which had been
imposed by the victors of the second Balkan War. It
was Roumania which had inflicted the shrewdest wound by
taking the whole of the Dobrudja as a recompense for a
military promenade, during which she lost a few men who
deserted, and a few officers who were shot in the back.
The Dobrudja is a land whose people cause it to resemble
a mosaic&mdash;Greeks, Turks, Roumanians, Tartars, Bulgars,
Armenians and gipsies are to be found&mdash;but the southern
parts are undoubtedly Bulgarian. After the great outcry
which the Bulgars had raised over the surrender of one
town, Silistra, it can be imagined that the loss of the
whole land came as an unendurable sentence. Quite
apart from Bulgaria's Macedonian aspirations, it was felt
in Belgrade that Ferdinand, by pointing to the Dobrudja,
would be able to drive his kingdom into an alliance with
the Central Powers, an alliance whose aim, as far as he
was concerned, was to leave him Tzar of the Balkans.
The photograph which he circulated of himself, seated in
a splendid chair upon a promontory by the Black Sea,
wearing the appropriate archaic robes, and with a look
of profound meditation on his otherwise Machiavellian
features, was exactly what he thought a Balkan Tzar
should be.</p>

<p>The Serbs were in favour of delivering an attack upon
the Bulgars before they had mobilized and concentrated
their troops. This would not have warded off the Teutonic
invasion, but the Serbs would have been able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
maintain contact with Salonica, thus facilitating the
evacuation of their army. And who knows whether this
diversion would not have induced the Greeks and the
Roumanians to change their attitude? However, the
proposal was vetoed by Serbia's great Allies, who thought
that their diplomacy might work upon the Bulgars.
Many worthy people said that it would be quite inconceivable
for the Bulgarian army to oppose the Russian,
seeing that this would be terrible ingratitude. But they
forgot that if the Russians had been, not for purely
altruistic motives, the kind patrons of the Bulgars, they
had recently&mdash;when the Tzar Nicholas and the Tzarina
came to the Constanza f&ecirc;tes&mdash;made open cause with
Bulgaria's opponents. They were also forgetting, rather
inexcusably, that the Bulgars were averse to the idea of
the Russians securing Constantinople. On the other
hand, the old pro-Russian sentiments of the people still
survived: the Russian Legation at Sofia received numerous
applications to serve in the army; large contributions
were made to the Russian Red Cross, and public
prayers were offered for the success of the Russian arms.
But the Muscovite Minister at Sofia was a man unfitted
for the post, and Ferdinand's task was made easier. The
Allied diplomats could argue, later on, that they failed by
a narrow margin, since Radoslavoff only succeeded in
gaining a majority by means of the help of the Turkish
deputies; but if the Sobranje had been hostile to Ferdinand
and Radoslavoff they would simply have dissolved
it. As a pattern of morals Dr. Radoslavoff is not worth
quotation&mdash;the offences for which during a previous
Premiership he was convicted were rather flagrant&mdash;but his
views on international politics are quite instructive. On
November 14, 1912, he wrote to his friend Mavrodieff,
the prefect of Sofia, a letter which was afterwards reproduced
in facsimile. "It is clear," he said, "that Russian
diplomacy is disloyal. It wants Constantinople....
But it is not only Russia which envies Bulgaria; the same
thing is true for Austria-Hungary and Germany. The
Balkan Union has surprised them, and they will seek a new
basis in their future politics...." But then the second
Balkan War and the Treaty of Bucharest enabled Ferdinand
to commit his country to an alliance which various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of his statesmen and generals vehemently deprecated.
"If the Germans should win," telegraphed Tocheff, the
Minister at Vienna, in August 1915, "that would be still
more dangerous for Bulgaria."</p>

<p>Ferdinand was sure that the Austro-Germans would
succeed in conquering the Serbs. On October 6, after a
treacherous artillery preparation, the two armies began
to cross at various points the Danube, the Save and the
Drin. Their losses in the hand-to-hand engagements
may have reminded them of a phrase in the official explanation
that was issued, after the rout of the previous
December, by the Viennese authorities: "The retirement
of our forces after their victorious offensive in Serbia has
given birth to divers rumours for the most part entirely
without foundation.... It was inevitable that we should
have important losses in men and material." So it was on
this occasion&mdash;at Belgrade, for example, thousands were
killed as they struggled to the shore&mdash;in a broad street
leading down to the harbour a brigade of Skoplje recruits
plunged through the Austrians with their knives. But
in the end, on October 10&mdash;and in spite of heroic work on
the part of some French and British naval detachments&mdash;Belgrade
fell. On October 12 the Bulgars attacked.
"The European War is drawing to its close," said Ferdinand's
proclamation. "The victorious armies of the
Central Powers are in Serbia and are rapidly advancing."
They advanced less rapidly than they had planned, thanks
to the wonderful exploits of the Serbian army, which was
heavily encumbered by the growing stream of fugitives.
The Austro-Germans failed to encircle the Serbian troops&mdash;slowly
and keeping in touch with those who were on the
Bulgarian frontier, the Serbs retired to the south and
west.</p>


<p class="section">ATTEMPT TO BUY OFF THE SERBS</p>

<p>The Government and the diplomatic corps had been
for some time at Ni&#353;, the second largest town, whose
Turkish character is disappearing. But the population
in the direst Turkish times were less exposed to epidemics
than the thousands of unwilling residents who thronged
the little, painted houses and the wide, cobbled streets in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
1915. It was at Ni&#353; that the negotiations were conducted
with Bulgaria, and in July an aged gentleman from Budapest
came with the offer of a separate peace. This
gentleman, a stockbroker of Slav origin, was imbued with
patriotic motives, for he was assured that Germany would
win the War. It was an undertaking in those days for a
man in his seventy-sixth year to travel, by way of
Roumania and Bulgaria, to Ni&#353;; but as he had connections
in Serbia he was resolved to see them, and he
travelled at his own expense, although the German Consul-General
at Buda-Pest, acting apparently for the Deutsche
Bank, had spoken of 18 million crowns for distribution
among the politicians at Ni&#353; and five millions for the old
stockbroker himself. His suggestion was that Serbia
should make certain small modifications in the Bucharest
Treaty in favour of the Bulgars, that Albania should be
hers up to and including Durazzo, that she should be
joined to Montenegro, and that her debts to the Entente
should be shouldered by Germany, which would likewise
give a considerable loan, and requested merely the permission
to send German troops down the Danube. "My
dear boy," said a Minister, an old friend of his, "go back
at once, or they'll lock you up in a mad-house." And when
the poor old gentleman got back he found himself compelled
to start a lawsuit against the Germans, since they
were unwilling to pay his costs. The Consul-General at
Pest disowned all knowledge of him, but the broker called
in the police as witnesses; for they had summoned him,
on more than one occasion, to explain why he was so much
in the Consul's company. The German Government said
also that he was a perfect stranger to them; but finally
they settled with him for a sum which is believed to have
been 35,000 crowns.</p>


<p class="section">GREEK TRANSACTIONS</p>

<p>One reason why the Entente had dissuaded the Serbs
from attacking Bulgaria was to prevent the <i>casus f&oelig;deris</i>
with Greece being jeopardized. This treaty between
Greece and Serbia would become operative by a Bulgarian
aggression&mdash;and the fox-faced M. Gounaris when he was
Prime Minister of Greece in August 1915 assured the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Allied Powers that Greece would never tolerate a Bulgarian
attack upon Serbia. It was largely on the strength
of this assurance that, when, a little later, the attitude of
Bulgaria grew menacing and the Serbian General Staff
suggested marching upon Sofia and nipping the Bulgarian
mobilization in the bud, the then Russian Foreign
Minister, M. Sazonov, supported in this by Sir Edward
Grey, warned Serbia not to take the initiative. Serbia
yielded to the demands of her great Allies, only to see
herself abandoned by the Greeks. King Constantine and
probably the greater part of his people were anxious to
remain outside the war. And to free himself from the
embarrassing Treaty with Serbia he declared that it would
only have applied if Serbia had been attacked by the
Bulgars. [We may say that it was doubtful whether the
<i>casus f&oelig;deris</i> arose when Serbia was attacked by Austria;
but it clearly and indubitably did arise when she was
attacked by Bulgaria. When Venizelos spoke of the
obligations of Greece towards Serbia, a certain Mr. Paxton
Hibben, an American admirer of Constantine, said in his
book, <i>Constantine I. and the Greek People</i> (New York, 1920),
that Venizelos was making an appeal to the sentimentality
of his countrymen!] So Constantine proclaimed
that Greece was neutral&mdash;"Our gallant Serbian allies," he
declared some five years later, when he returned from
exile, "Our gallant Serbian allies"; and the Athenian
mob&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">August Athena! where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where are thy men of might, thy grand in soul?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">&mdash;the Athenian mob cheered itself hoarse. One word
from Constantine and they would have wrecked the
Serbian Legation and the French and the British for the
terrible bad taste of not exposing their flags. But Constantine,
clutching his German Field-Marshal's baton (or
perhaps it was the native baton given to the royal leader
who in the Balkan War wiped out some of the ignominy
with which the previous Turkish War had covered him),
at any rate Constantine restrained himself. Why the
devil couldn't these Serbs understand that they were his
gallant allies! Let them wipe out the unhappy past.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Had they never heard of that magnificent French actress
who, being asked about the paternity of her son, replied
that she really did not know? "Alas!" she said, "I am
so shortsighted." Well, it was true that in 1915 he had
been neutral and unable to tolerate the presence of Serbian
soldiers on his territory; if they found themselves obliged
to leave their country and retreated by way of Greece he
gave orders to have them disarmed. This was the attitude
imposed upon a neutral. And thousands and thousands
of them had unfortunately died in consequence while
passing over the Albanian mountains. "Our alliance
with Serbia," quoth the King while opening the Chamber
in 1921&mdash;"our alliance with Serbia now drawn closer as
the result of so many sacrifices and heroic struggles...."
The son of the eagle, as his people call him, stopped a
moment, but could hear no laughter. As for his policy in
1915, he had been perhaps a neutral lacking in benevolence.
If he and his Ministers did not actually refuse to receive
the non-combatant young Serbs they very certainly did not
go out of their way to offer any shelter to these erstwhile
little allies in distress, when the alternative to Greece was
wild Albania. Twenty thousand Serbian children lost
their lives upon those bleak and trackless mountains.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
It was most unfortunate. And in the Cathedral of Athens,
in the gorgeous presence of the clergy and the more responsible
sections of the population, the King chuckled
to himself as he was acclaimed with cries of "Christos
aneste!" (Christ is risen!). After all, those 20,000
Serbian boys would not have lived for ever. These
excellent Athenians were resolved that bygones should be
bygones. It was perfectly true that British soldiers and
French, entrapped and shot down by his command, were
buried away yonder in Pir&aelig;us cemetery. He felt like
having a good laugh, but if you are a King you must be
dignified....</p>


<p class="section">FLIGHT OF THE SERBS</p>

<p>Ni&#353; fell on November 4, 1915, King Peter's plate,
according to the subsequent avowals of one Brust, a non-commissioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
officer, being distributed among the 145th
Prussian Regiment, the Colonel annexing ten pieces and
several privates receiving spoons and knives&mdash;and now
the Serbs had to leave their country. On the other side
of the Albanian mountains they might hope to find a land
of exile. It is said that several of the Ministers contemplated
suicide&mdash;the Minister of War had so far lost his
head that, after reaching Salonica by way of Monastir,
he refused to join his colleagues at Scutari&mdash;but the venerable
Pa&#353;i&#263; did not lose his jovial humour. He may have
laughed in order to encourage those who were despairing.
On the other hand, he may have known that Serbia would
rise, and rise to greater heights. He made no secret of
the satisfaction which he felt when the Bulgars attacked,
for this, he said, would settle once for all the Macedonian
question. Whether the attitude of the Southern Slavs in
Austria-Hungary appealed to him in equal measure is a
little doubtful. It was hard for him, at his time of life,
to envisage anything more than a Greater Serbia.</p>


<p class="section">THE FAITHFUL CROATS</p>

<p>But the Croats, as is shown by other documents from
the Zagreb archives, were faithful to their race. The
extracts, by the way, reply to those foolish Italians who
persisted for years in shouting that the Croats had been
the fiercest foes of the Entente. That they were the foes
of Italy is not surprising, for the provisions of the wretched
Treaty of London, concluded behind the back of the
British Parliament and without even the Cabinet being
consulted, were by this time public property, and it was
seen that the Italians had succeeded in persuading the
Entente to promise them the reversion of a great slice of
Yugoslav territory, very large portions of which were as
completely Yugoslav as the island of Scedro (Torcola),
whose population consists of one Slav woman called Yaka&#353;,
over eighty years of age. Save for their sentiments
towards the Italians, it is clear that a large number of
Croats were very warmly and very actively on the side of
the Entente. I am sure that the unfortunate Italians of
the Trentino who, like them, were enrolled in the Imperial
and Royal army were as eager to desert, and no doubt if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
they had been more numerous we should have had an
Italian contingent fighting with the Russians, in association
with the Czecho-Slovak and the Yugoslav brigades.</p>

<p>In spite of the ten months' war with Serbia, in spite of
the notable executions of native citizens for assisting the
enemy at the time of his incursion into Syrmia and
Bosnia, there has latterly been an alarming increase in the
number of cases of grossest insult to the person of H.M.
the Emperor and King; outbreaks of deeply felt, only
forcibly controlled hatred against everything friendly
to the dynasty and the Monarchy, curses upon the exalted
wearer of the Crown, glorification of King Peter and the
Serb realm, expressed by men and women alike, are of
daily occurrence....</p>

<p class="center" style="padding-top: 1em">(H)</p>

<p>In this document we return to the subject of desertions:</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%; text-indent: 0em">
<span class="smcap">Royal Hungarian 42nd Infantry of the Line</span>.<br />

<span style="padding-left: 16em"><span class="smcap">Czernawka</span>, <i>August</i> 12, 1915.</span>
</p>

<p>In the period from the 8/8 to the 9/8 two men of the
10th company have deserted (of whom one is probably
wandering somewhere behind the front, as he is mentally
deficient, having even gone away without a cap and being
a Roman Catholic); likewise four men of the 12th company
and all the men recently enrolled from the village
of Dolnji Lapac, of the Greek Orthodox religion, have
apparently deserted to the foe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The impressions which I had of these men&mdash;impressions
based on a personal intercourse of several hours while they
were being marched to the recruiting depot&mdash;was unfavourable.
And this I immediately made known in writing to
the regimental command, with a brief note on this point
on the 6/8 to the 11th Corps command. Unhappily my
impressions were correct; there are scoundrels in these
ranks. I have for the present instituted a most thorough
and severe examination, wherein I am already myself
participating; for I am inflexibly determined, at the very
smallest sign of a recurrence, to apply to these traitors the
military judicial procedure and, if necessary, to have the
men decimated, as I was unfortunately compelled to do
with the Bosnian-Herzegovinian line regiment No. 4 last
winter, which method had the most excellent results.
That regiment has thenceforward been blameless.... I
am so very well informed as to conditions in the south
that I cannot be deceived, and I know that, in spite of all&mdash;including
some misguided&mdash;measures, there are still a
number of traitors, some of them occupying a high social
position, moving about freely in Croatia-Slavonia instead
of being strangled.</p>

<p>So that steps may be taken against the families of
guilty persons, I enclose a list of the men who have
deserted from the middle of June, this year. I beg that
I may be supported to the uttermost, without the slightest
wavering, and in a short time&mdash;so my experience tells me&mdash;we
shall be in a most satisfactory position.</p>

<p>We then get an elaborate and indignant dissertation,
dated November 1915 and signed by Lieut.-Colonel
Olleschick. It is a study of the way in which the secret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
police was hampered and its patriotic activities watered
down; the Colonel also exposes the manner in which
antipatriotic, or shall we say anti-Habsburg, citizens
of Croatia-Slavonia are protected:</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%; text-indent: 0em">
<span class="smcap">Imperial and Royal Military Command in Zagreb</span>.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em"><i>Chief of the General Staff.</i></span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">K. No. 1681.</span></p>

<p>The Colonel expresses his unbounded approval of
Maravi&#263;, the chief of this branch of the police, and of von
Klobu&#269;ari&#263;, a police captain. The former, who is dead,
was for many years at the head of the police at Zemlin,
opposite Belgrade, and has left behind a reputation for
fairness. The whereabouts of von Klobu&#269;ari&#263; are unknown,
and it would be prudent if this ex-Austrian officer,
ex-dentist's assistant and ex-policeman were to ensure their
remaining so. The Ban is accused of having frustrated
various designs of this couple. He is further accused
of having placed at the head of the Koprivnica internment
camp&mdash;where 6000 "politically untrustworthy" Serbs
were assembled&mdash;the mayor, Kamenar, who himself had
been dismissed for his political untrustworthiness; and
when the military protested, they received no answer,
while the mayor&mdash;so the wrathful writer hears&mdash;has been
removed from his post at the internment camp and restored
to his former office and dignity. The colonel asks
how it is that in Croatia the crimes of "Majest&auml;tsbeleidigung"
and high treason are seldom punished with more
than three or four months' incarceration, while in other
parts of the Empire they are visited with death or at least
a sentence of several years. (The answer is that in Croatia
the Government was obliged, on account of the language,
to employ Croatian judges.) He mentions that Professor
Arshinov, alleged to have come to Zagreb in order to carry
on an anti-Habsburg and pro-Serbian propaganda, is
indeed under arrest, but is being far too well treated at the
hospital, where he receives his Serbian associates and even
has convivial evenings with them. In fact the whole
country, so the writer asserts, is saturated with Serbian
sympathies and agitators. He says that in some villages
every functionary, from the highest to the lowest, is a
Serb; the <i>gendarmerie</i>, the tax-gatherers and the foresters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
are frequently Serbs and he regards it as noteworthy that
the hotels, inns and caf&eacute;s are almost exclusively in Serbian
hands; "and it is only too well known,"&mdash;so he rather
strangely says&mdash;"that these are the places where suspicious
characters are wont to hatch their secret plans
under the influence of alcohol." He complains at length
of the anti-Austrian activities of the Serbo-Croatian
Coalition, and this proves that the party was not, as its
critics have said, too subservient to the Habsburgs.</p>


<p class="section">HOW THE SERBS CAME TO THEIR PATRIARCH'S TOWN</p>

<p>At the end of November the Serbian army, with the
Government and thousands of refugees, arrived at the
ancient towns of Prizren and Pe&#263;. It was at the rambling
old patriarchal town of Pe&#263; that the Serbian soldiers
had to do a thing which even their marvellous optimism
could not endure&mdash;most of the field guns had now to be
destroyed, after a few years of crowded and victorious
life. An American correspondent, Mr. Fortier Jones,
tells us<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> how a gunner asked to be photographed beside
his beloved weapon, and how, when he wanted to leave
his address, he suddenly realized that with the loss of this
gun he would be a mere homeless wanderer. It was not
surprising that these steel-built stoics, than whom all
French and British witnesses agree there are no better
fighters in the world, should have broken down at this
ordeal. As for the chauffeurs, they were busy polishing
their cars and cleaning their engines&mdash;presumably through
force of habit&mdash;prior to the breaking up of all these
touring-cars and lorries. Some were saturated with
petrol and set on fire, others were exploded with hand
grenades, but the most imaginative method was to drive
the car up to that place, two or three miles from Pe&#263;,
where the road to Andrievica turned into a horse-trail
on the side of the precipice. Here the chauffeur would
jump out, after having let in the clutch and pushed down
the accelerator&mdash;and the car would leap into space,
three or four hundred feet over a mountain torrent.
From this point the <i>via dolorosa</i> stretched away precariously,
at first a winding path of ice and then a track<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
across the snowdrifts of the barren uplands. The Serbian
Government had offered to construct this very necessary
road to Andrievica; the engineer, one Smodlaka, undertook
to build it in three months, but Nikita's Minister
replied that the Austrian prisoners, whom it was proposed
to use, were mostly in the grip of spotted fever. This
was not the case, and one of the results of there being no
road was that nearly all the supplies from Russia for
the Montenegrins were abandoned at Pe&#263;. Cold, starvation
and exposure took a fearful toll among the straggling
wanderers&mdash;between 1000 and 1500 were cut off and
murdered by savage Albanians (whose considerate treatment
of the Serbs is highly praised by their champion, Miss
Edith Durham. Reviewing in the <i>Daily Herald</i> a book of
Serbian tales that have precious little to do with Albania, she
goes out of her way to laud, in those days of the terrible retreat,
the kindliness of her prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.) As we have mentioned,
of the 36,000 boys who accompanied the army in order
to escape the Austrians, only some 16,000 reached the
Adriatic, where it was said that there was nothing human
left of them except their eyes. They had lived on roots
and bark of trees, they drank the water into which decomposed
corpses had been thrown. Of the 50,000
Austrian prisoners&mdash;many of them Yugoslavs&mdash;about
44,000 died in the course of their eight weeks' retreat;
none of them were heard to complain or seen committing
any brutal act. Very many Englishwomen were included
in this long procession; old King Peter walked a good
deal of the way, the Archbishop of Belgrade brought the
relics of Stephen the First-Crowned and was followed by
priests with lighted tapers, and Marshal Putnik, whom
exposure would have killed, was carried all the way
inside a primitive sedan-chair.... "Whence do you
come and what are you?" asked a Serbian woman<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> of
the wounded and dying. "We are," they replied in
prose that reminds one of Mestrovi&#263;, "we are the smouldering
torches with which our country is kept warm. In
the heart of one's native land there is neither truth nor
justice&mdash;we love our native land; this love is a barrier
against human love; the heart of one's native land is
great and selfish and it throbs&mdash;in this heart is the faith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of all our hearts, we love our native land. We watch over
it and we defend it and we love, though the lettering
upon our tomb be enveloped in ivy. Formidable is its
victory, and we will march along, not asking whether
anybody will return. We love our native land and even
when the blood is thickening inside our throats and we
are carrying our entrails in our hands." Though they
were Serbs they had forgotten how to sing; it was some
time later that the words, now famous, of "Tamo daleko"
burst from the inspired lips of a simple soldier and were
taken up by his companions: "There, far away, far
away by the Morava, there is my village, there is my
love...."</p>

<p>"They came exhausted into Scutari, one by one or in
small groups," says Monsieur Boppe, the French Minister,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
"some of them on horseback, some on foot; here and
there one saw a trace of military order, but most of them
had no weapons. They looked as if they could not
march another mile, these moving skeletons, so painfully
they crawled along, so haggard, so emaciated, with
a colour so cadaverous and eyes so dull. This mournful
band of brothers struggled into Scutari for days, beneath
the rain and through the mud. No bitterness came from
the lips of those who had undergone every privation;
as if impelled by destiny, they passed along in silence;
from time to time, indeed, one heard them say 'hleba'
(bread)&mdash;that was the only word they had the strength
to pronounce. For several days the majority of them
had had nothing to eat, and in the cantonments where
they were lodged outside the town their Government
could only provide a meagre ration." A hundredweight
of maize cost 300 francs in gold.... But what of the
women who had remained in Belgrade? Miss Annie
Christi&#263;, whose unflagging work for her people is so well
known in this country, has told us how the Austro-Hungarians
started paying out relief money to the families
of State officials. They advertised their generosity on
a large scale, but the amounts were very small, and many
women were too proud to accept this dole from the enemy.
They preferred to do any kind of work offered by the
municipality of Belgrade. Thus one saw women in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
furs or smart clothes&mdash;the remnants of former days&mdash;trundling
wheelbarrows of stone for road repairs, or
carrying heavy loads. Delicately nurtured girls could
be seen working at the slaughterhouse among the entrails
and offal for twelve hours on end. The wife of a professor
scrubbed office floors for many months before her husband
at the front could send her any money. Street-sweeping
was a common occupation for women of all classes.</p>

<p>"We rescued the gallant Serbian army," said the
Italians, in the course of a long and rhetorical placard
which in 1919 they pasted up throughout Rieka and the
Adriatic lands they occupied, and which was not more
convincing than the caravan of Dalmatian mayors whom,
after the War, they very proudly exhibited in Paris, a
suave official from the Embassy acting as the showman.
(The Italian authorities had taken in hand the election
of these mayors&mdash;save Signor Ziliotto of Zadar, who was
elected by his fellow-townsmen.) ... When the wretched
Serbs who found themselves staggering through central
Albania&mdash;among them large numbers of boys so young
that they would not have been called up until 1919&mdash;when
they hoped to reach the Adriatic at Valona, they were
told that this route was barred to them. Having eluded
the Austrians, the Germans and the Bulgars, they were
left by the Italians to die of starvation and fatigue. It
may well have seemed to them, as to Bedros Tourian,
the Armenian poet, that "All the world is but God's
mockery." When King Peter, worn out by the journey
and his ailments, reached Valona by way of Durazzo, he
was ordered by the commandant of that place to depart
with his suite&mdash;which consisted of four persons&mdash;within
twenty-four hours.... In the middle of December a
French relief mission arrived on the Albanian coast,
General de Mond&eacute;sir reached Scutari and a large British
mission under General Taylor landed at Durazzo. These
did what was possible to save the remnants of the Serbian
army. But, after a short time, a fresh series of obstacles
arose. The King of Montenegro, very loyal to the
Austrians, facilitated their advance across his country.
Thus it was impracticable for the Serbs to concentrate
and to embark from those few wooden huts which are
called, in Italian, San Giovanni di Medua. Between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
bare cliffs and the sea the miserable men and boys and
women were compelled to plod towards the south. One
hundred and fifty thousand survivors were eventually
carried by the Allies to Corfu.</p>


<p class="section">THE SHADOW OVER MONTENEGRO</p>

<p>These had been busy days for Nikita and his sons. A
royal order was issued to the Montenegrin military and
police authorities, commanding them to prevent the
population from giving or selling any provisions to the
Serbian army. "Ne bogami, svetoga mi Vassilija ne!"
["Goodness gracious, no! And by St. Basil, no!"] was
the phrase which greeted the Serbs;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and when they
remonstrated with the Montenegrins for demanding eleven
Serbian dinars in silver for ten Montenegrin perpers&mdash;the
exchange was at par, but the people were acting
under orders&mdash;"If I had ten sons I would give them to
King Peter," was the usual reply, "but money is money."
Yet the Austrians were not as grateful as they might
have been. Nikita was intending, after the annihilation
of the Serbs, to conclude a separate peace with Austria
and to rule, as an Austrian satrap, over an enlarged
territory. But they ignored his aspirations; they did
not take into account that he had been so kind to them
at Lov&#269;en and elsewhere. They swarmed over his country&mdash;this
time he was not play-acting when he showed his
indignation&mdash;and the deceived deceiver was forced to fly.
On January 10, Lov&#269;en had fallen. A characteristic
telegram:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ku&#269;a mi gori,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ku&#269;i mi trebaju&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">["My house is burning, I want the Ku&#269;i"] was sent by
Nikita to his best fighting men, the Ku&#269;i, whom he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
left in reserve at Danilovgrad. When General Gajni&#263;
received this he marched all night with his brigade and
reached Cetinje in the morning. Nikita met them and
announced that, after all, he did not require them. He
would conquer without them. And Lov&#269;en fell.</p>

<p>That Adriatic Gibraltar, which rises gaunt and sheer
to some 6000 feet, was entrusted by Nikita to his youngest
son, Prince Peter, a young man of marvellous vanity.
He used to deny, after the surrender of Lov&#269;en, that he
had consorted at Budva with Lieut.-Colonel Hupka, the
former military attach&eacute; at Cetinje, whom the Austrians
brought specially from the Italian front for this purpose.
The well-known patriot, Dr. Machiedo of Zadar, who
happened to be confined during the summer of 1915 by
the Austrians in the fortress of Gora&#382;da, which lies above
Kotor, read in the telephone book certain messages from
Prince Peter, asking for an interview with Hupka&mdash;these
messages were carried by a patrol to the lines and thence
telephoned to Gora&#382;da. When the Prince at last acknowledged
that he had been meeting Hupka&mdash;which
he naturally had done at his father's command&mdash;he stated
that it was with the object of preventing the bombardment
of open towns by Austrian aeroplanes. Between
him and Hupka the arrangements were made; many of
the Austrians exchanged their military boots for the
Serbian national sandals, so that they could more easily
scale the rocks; and Peter sent verbal orders to his two
outlying brigadiers that they must not resist. General
Pejanovi&#263; demanded, however, that this should be put
in writing, and the document is extant. Thirteen Austrians
lie buried in a little graveyard on the slopes of Lov&#269;en,
mostly men who missed their footing; and this was the
price that Austria paid for the tremendous mountain
that she had coveted for years; she had been willing,
more than once, to let the Montenegrins, in exchange for
it, have Scutari. The great picture of "The Storming of
Lov&#269;en," which Gabriel Jurki&#263;, the Sarajevo artist, was
commissioned by the Austrians to paint, was never
painted; and when Nikita motored out from Cetinje to
meet the men who were retiring from Lov&#269;en he had the
hardihood to rebuke them as traitors. "It is not we who
are traitors," shouted a colonel, "it is you and your sons!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
"Oh! that I must hear such words!" groaned the King,
"I want to die!" But he did not die; on the contrary,
he went to Paris. His eldest son had announced, early
in the campaign, that he was unwell, and he had gone to
France by way of Athens. There he was very accurately
told by Constantine in which month Mackensen and the
Bulgars would descend upon Serbia. When the Prince
arrived at Nice he mentioned this to his friend, Jovo
Popovi&#263;, the former Montenegrin Minister at Constantinople,
and to Radovi&#263;. They advised him to inform the
Entente, in order to rehabilitate himself. But when he
telegraphed to his father the reply was "Be quiet."
Prince Danilo has never denied the allegations that while
he was at Nice, Signor Carminatti, the Montenegrin Consul-General
in Milan, conducted negotiations on his behalf at
Lugano with a certain Herr Bernsdorf of the Deutsche
Bank, with a view to a separate peace by Montenegro. The
amount of the financial consideration is not known. And
the business-like Prince, realizing that it would be impossible
for him to return to his native land, secured himself against
the future by selling, through a couple of confidential
agents, his real estate to the Austrians. He likewise disposed
of a good deal of forest which is alleged to have belonged
not to him but to the State, and when his father heard of
the resulting sum of a hundred million francs he was exceedingly
annoyed that this robbery and trafficking with
the enemy during the War had only replenished Danilo's
and not his own exchequer. When his political opponents
heard of these transactions he denied, over and over again,
that they had taken place; but we have his autograph
letter on the subject to Danilo. Before the King left
Montenegro he found another opportunity for a grandiose
attitude. He appeared at Podgorica where he made an
eloquent speech, exhorting his people to march on the
morrow against the hated Austrian and assuring them
that their old King would fire the first shot, whereas he
decamped in the night for Scutari, which is in the
opposite direction. He and the Queen, Prince Peter and
Miu&#353;kevi&#263;, the Premier, fled the country; while Prince
Mirko, the remainder of the Cabinet, the National Assembly
and&mdash;above all&mdash;the army had instructions to remain
behind. How much easier it would have been for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
his army than for the Serbs to reach Corfu. But this
terrible old man delivered 50,000 of the best Yugoslav
soldiers to the enemy. On January 21 he sailed away.
I do not know if anybody sang the National Anthem&mdash;"Onamo!
Onamo!" ["Yonder! Yonder!"]&mdash;which in
his youth Nikita had himself composed. And a few
years later when the gallant Montenegrins could again
lift up their voices and sing "Onamo!" how many of
them thought of him who was skulking and of course
intriguing yonder in France.</p>

<p>We have alluded to the treatment which in their
distress the Serbs received from their Italian Allies;
but in Albania the Italian army did render a certain
amount of assistance&mdash;every day at eleven o'clock the
Austrian aeroplanes would reach Durazzo, and the Italian
soldiers, sentries and all, would rush helter-skelter from
the plentiful food to which they were just sitting down.
The Serbs, many of them, after their privations, looking
like grey ghosts, were always in the neighbourhood of
the Italian barracks and very glad they were to see those
aeroplanes which permitted them to enter in and enjoy
a bounteous meal. When the senior Italian officer
complained to his Serbian colleague, "Surely," said
the latter, "you have a sentry at the door. He can
prevent anyone from going in." At some distance inland
a Serbian major, a friend of mine, was resting on the side
of the road; he had eaten nothing for four days. A
spick-and-span Italian lieutenant of <i>gendarmerie</i> paused
in front of him and was clearly interested. The major
wondered whether he would have some food about him.
But the lieutenant did not even offer him a cigarette.
"Pardon me," he said with a friendly smile, "but will
you allow me to take a photograph?" Large numbers
of mules were brought over by the Italians and apparently
it gave them pleasure to cut their throats. The officers
purchased many Serbian horses&mdash;their owners were too
destitute to bargain. But in fairness it must be said that
some Italian ships worked with the French and British
vessels in conveying the Serbs, soldiers and civilians,
from the coast of Albania.</p>

<p>As for the Montenegrin King, he had attempted,
before his departure, to put the whole blame on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
shoulders of Colonel Pe&#353;i&#263;. He sent&mdash;in order to make
more certain the success of the Austrian army&mdash;a telegraphic
command<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> to the Voivoda Djuro Petrovi&#263;, the
chief of the Herzegovinian detachment, in which he
required him to destroy his cannons and machine guns
and then (although the enemy was exerting no pressure
upon him) to withdraw towards Nik&#353;i&#263;. This order was
issued in the name of Colonel Pe&#353;i&#263;, the signature being
forged. In fact Nikita thought his Serbian Chief of Staff
was quite a useful personage. But there exists a letter
in which the Colonel wrote that, in order to avoid capitulation,
a supreme effort would be necessary at certain
positions which he indicated and anyhow the army should
be withdrawn to Scutari and the defence of the town
organized. Scutari, by the way, was the scene of another
of Nikita's exploits: he caused the Bank of Montenegro
to send money to the Austrian Consul there, the cash
being delivered by Martinovi&#263;, the Montenegrin Consul.
It was used to incite the Albanians to take military
action against the Serbs between Prizren and Djakovica.
When this affair was exposed all the Montenegrins knew
by what traitors they were governed. The fall of Montenegro
had been brought about more swiftly by the Austrian
submarines which in the Gulf of San Giovanni di Medua
torpedoed practically every ship that carried food or
munitions, while other boats were not molested. An
investigation showed that the shipping news had been
telegraphed to Prince Peter, and he in his turn handed
it on to the Austrians. The Prince's egregious parent
wanted to be in a position to say that, owing to the lack
of food and munitions, he had been compelled to surrender.
One of his final acts was to summon the Skup&#353;tina, as
he did not wish to be saddled with the responsibility of
making peace. At a secret sitting on December 11,
1915,&mdash;when the retreating Serbs were in San Giovanni,
Scutari and Podgorica,&mdash;the Government declared that
they had no resources, that the Entente could not assist
them and that they would wage war for so long as they
had the means&mdash;in other words, that the war would cease.
It was continued, however, by those Montenegrin troops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
between Kola&#353;in and Bielo Polje, who&mdash;even after the
fall of Lov&#263;en on January 10, and the flowing of the
Austrian army towards Scutari&mdash;were ordered to make a
counter-offensive, during which they had over 1500 dead
and wounded. The reason for this was that Nikita wished
to prevent his army from escaping to Scutari; he was
afraid lest, if they escaped with the Serbs, they would
dethrone him forthwith. Afterwards he gave an explanation
that he had ordered the Chief of Staff, Yanko Vukoti&#263;,
to rescue the army, which order he alleged he had wirelessed
from Brindisi. Vukoti&#263;, together with Prince Mirko
and the Ministers who stayed behind, declared in the
<i>Pester Lloyd</i> that Nikita was lying. They added that
he could have sent no wireless from Brindisi, because
there was at that time no receiving station in Montenegro,
the French one at Podgorica having been destroyed at
the order of the British Minister, Count de Salis, the doyen
of the diplomatic corps. The King, by the way, had
endeavoured for some time to rid himself of the diplomats,
who were inconvenient witnesses of what was in progress.
On December 31 a telegram was sent by the Ministers of
France, Great Britain, Italy and Russia, in which they
said that "Apparently our presence is displeasing to the
King and he is trying to disengage himself from us. He
has begged us on several occasions to depart and last
night he insisted, with the asseveration that in forty-eight
hours it would be too late. We suspect that His Majesty is
playing a very ambiguous game...." And on January 9
the French Minister telegraphed, among other things,
that "My Russian and English colleagues are of opinion
that the King is merely performing a comedy with us
and that this comedy will end in a tragedy for the belligerents."
Nikita, on his arrival in France, proposed to
settle down at Lyons, but the French authorities did not
care for him to be so close to Switzerland, which was one
of his intriguing centres. So they placed at his disposal
a ch&acirc;teau near Bordeaux and it was not until he had
made repeated requests that they permitted him to come
to Neuilly, a suburb of Paris. He replaced Miu&#353;kevi&#263;
as Premier by Radovi&#263;, the former victim of the Bomb
Trial, hoping by this move towards the Left to silence his
critics. But in August 1916 Radovi&#263; presented a memorandum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in favour of the formal union between Montenegro
and Serbia, under King Peter's son and King
Nicholas' grandson, Prince Alexander. The Montenegrin
monarch was enraged at this and, after Radovi&#263; had
resigned, one after another all the Montenegrins of any
standing withdrew from Nikita, who was openly working
against the Serbs. He and the Princess Xenia conducted
all the Government business, though he distributed among
his tiny clique of adherents various empty titles. An
aged friend of his, Eugene Popovi&#263;, a native of Triest and
a naturalized Italian, was made Premier, to give pleasure
to Italy; a more active person was the War Minister,
Hajdukovi&#263;, a former shipping contractor in Constantinople,
where a long time ago he had been one of those
young Montenegrins who, to the number of twenty, the
Sultan used to educate&mdash;a process which, in the case of
idle boys, was not very irksome. During the Great War
Hajdukovi&#263; was invited by the Allies to quit Salonica,
as they had certain suspicions against him. He had
also, on behalf of his King, urged the Montenegrin volunteers
who had managed to get to Salonica not to allow
themselves to be commanded by Serbian or French
officers, but to demand Montenegrin officers, of whom there
was no adequate supply. These men had ultimately
to be sent to Corsica and kept there till the end of the
War. What Hajdukovi&#263; performed at Salonica, another
royal agent, one Vukovi&#263;, a bootmaker, attempted at
Marseilles, where he continually went on board the vessels
that were bringing Montenegrins and, to a smaller extent,
other Yugoslavs from the United States and South
America to the Salonica front. These travelled men were
less easily influenced than those who obeyed Hajdukovi&#263;;
but 300-400 did refuse to proceed. They were installed
in a factory at Orange, where the Montenegrin Government
fed them and paid them. Now and then they were
encouraged by being told that if they had gone to the
Front the Serbian officers would have flogged them....
And so the little Court at Neuilly occupied the years
with many a congenial intrigue. Feelers were stretched
out to this country, where an English edition of Radovi&#263;'s
<i>Montenegrin Bulletin</i>, the pro-Yugoslav organ, was being
published by my friend Vassilje Buri&#263; to the furious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
indignation of the busybodies who supported the King
and of the Italian Embassy. From these two sources
and from Neuilly the Foreign Office was bombarded
with protests, begging it in the name of justice, etc., to
put a stop to this dire scandal. One day a charming
Foreign Office clerk, an acquaintance of mine, had Buri&#263;
to lunch at the Royal Automobile Club; in the course
of the meal he suggested that, as Buri&#263; was not looking
well, they two should have a little holiday in France.
Buri&#263; said he would be very glad to go with him, but he
thought it would be nice to stay in England. The charming
official held out for the Continent, and with such
obstinacy that Buri&#263; at last put his hand upon his arm
and invited him to promise that they would both of them
come back to England. Thereupon the host acknowledged
that a perfect flood of letters had been pouring on the
Foreign Office with respect to the <i>Montenegrin Bulletin</i>,
and they were weary of receiving them.... Sometimes
the Neuilly Court was plunged in gloom, as when old
Tomo Oraovac's little book appeared with seventy-five
awkward questions to Nikita. For three days the King
shut himself up in his room, trying to decide as to whether
he should issue an answer. He decided to do nothing.
Now and then a French review or newspaper referred to
him. "The official courtesies extended by the French
Government to Nicholas <span class="smcap">i.</span> and his family should not
deceive the public," said the eminent publicist Monsieur
Gauvain in the <i>Revue de Paris</i> (March 1917). M. Gauvain
showed that the Petrovi&#263; dynasty constituted the sole
obstacle to a union of Montenegro with Serbia and the
rest of the Yugoslav lands. As Nikita drove past the
office of the <i>Revue de Paris</i> he may have been thinking,
rather wistfully, of that brave afternoon at Nik&#353;i&#263;.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> ...
Sometimes the old man was worried by his sons. Peter,
for example, who had been the spoilt child and who
had been given posts for which he was unfitted, now discovered
in himself, during the autumn of 1918, a great
desire to obtain a certain Madame Violette Brunet, the
legal wife of Monsieur Brunet, who was in Nikita's service.
The ardent lover, regardless of the ancient Montenegrin
custom which inflicted stoning on the guilty married<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
woman, while the husband sometimes cut her nose off,
wrote to his parents, asking them to arrange the matter,
and when the ex-King raised objections, Peter blackmailed
him by threatening to divulge to the world at large
all the unsavoury details connected with Lov&#263;en. "My
dear son," wrote Nikita in November 1918,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> "You write
again asking me to send an emissary to represent myself
and your mother in suing for the hand of the woman of
your choice, failing this, you say you will make a scandal
whereby the honour of both of us and of the whole family
will suffer; to obviate this unpleasant possibility we may
see our way to agree to your wish, but under the following
conditions...."</p>


<p class="section">THE BROKEN SERBS AT CORFU</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Serbs had, ever since the early days of
1916 when they began arriving in Corfu, been hard at
work upon their army. Thousands landed at Corfu in
such a state that only with continual care, with warmth
and nourishing food could they be rescued. But on the
little island of Vido where they were deposited the tents
were few, the beds were fewer, wood was lacking, so that
fires could not be made, and thousands died where they
sank down, amid the olive groves and orange trees. The
doctors nursed as many as they could in that one empty
building; but for very long about a hundred corpses
were each day piled in a little boat and taken out to sea.
Usually they had died of pure exhaustion. Out of the
16,000 boys who had scrambled along with the army as
far as Durazzo, about 2000 died on the sea and another
7000 on the Isle of Vido.</p>

<p>At Corfu the Serbs, with the other Yugoslavs, had also
to set about securing the foundations of their State that
was to be. The Russians, at the time of the negotiations
which ended in the Treaty of London, had been looking
forward to an Orthodox State, a Greater Serbia, bounded
by the river Narenta. This, if it had been carried out,
would have jettisoned, and probably for ever, the Croats
and Slovenes. That was the incredibly stupid old Russian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
policy of identifying Slav patriotism with the Orthodox
Church, a policy held up to ridicule by Strossmayer. It
was the Yugoslav Committee, working chiefly in London,
assisted by English friends, working there and at Corfu,
which caused the Serbs, the Croats and Slovenes to publish
on July 20, 1917, the historic Corfu Declaration, which
laid it down that the nation of the three names was resolved
to free itself from every foreign yoke and to become
a constitutional, democratic and Parliamentary Monarchy
under the Karageorgevi&#263; dynasty. It is said that those
two excellent friends of the Southern Slavs, the brilliant
Mr. Wickham Steed and Dr. Seton-Watson, than whom no
publicist is more conscientious, had to face a determined
opposition on the part of M. Pa&#353;i&#263; before it was agreed
that the Roman Catholic religion should in the prospective
State have equal rights with the Orthodox. One would
be disposed to criticize the Serbian Premier on account
of a narrow policy dictated by his excessive wish for self-preservation&mdash;he
saw very well that these clauses of
equality might undermine the long reign of the Radicals&mdash;but
it must be acknowledged that if the Southern Slavs
had limited themselves to a Greater Serbia, in which the
Radical party had been supreme, they would not have
wasted so much of their energy, after the War, in domestic
political conflict. They would also, very probably, have
gained more favourable terms from the Entente; and the
union with the Croats and Slovenes might have been
effected later. But against this is the opinion of those
who argue that the separation would have become permanent.
However, if the union of the Southern Slavs
could not be postponed, we may believe that it would
have been wise to call the new country, for a couple of
years, Greater Serbia. No doubt the logical Italians would
have pointed out to the rest of the Entente that their
bugbears, the Croats and the Slovenes, were included in this
State; but the Allies as a whole would have been more
inclined to be indulgent towards a country whose name
they honoured than towards the same country whose
various new-fangled designations&mdash;Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes; or Yugoslavia; or S.H.S.&mdash;they
found so puzzling. The Transylvanians who, one supposes,
will play the chief r&ocirc;le in Greater Roumania have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
as yet, much to the profit of all the Roumanians, permitted
the retention of that name. This course was not adopted
by the Southern Slavs, and Pa&#353;i&#263; giving way to Messrs.
Steed and Seton-Watson, appointed M. Yovanovi&#263; to
London with the object of working on the lines of the
Declaration of Corfu.</p>


<p class="section">THE SOUTHERN SLAVS IN THE UNITED STATES</p>

<p>The building of the new State and its army was also
being undertaken with great fervour in America, New
Zealand and Australia. North America contained about
100,000 Orthodox Serbs, 200,000 Catholic Slovenes and
400,000 Catholic Croats; South America had some
50,000 Yugoslavs, chiefly Catholic Dalmatians; while
the 8000-10,000 in Australasia were mostly of that origin.
Two kinds of Southern Slav newspapers were being
printed in North America, namely those which the Austrian
Ambassador supported, and those which were national.
The chief argument of the former species was the Treaty
of London, which, as the editors pointed out, gave up a
large part of Dalmatia to the Italians. Two of these
editors, by the way, were imprisoned for other reasons
by the authorities. They had constantly threatened the
terrible punishment that Austria would inflict on those
who had worked against the Fatherland&mdash;many of the
Southern Slavs, like the Roumanians, Czechs, Ruthenians
and Magyars, were employed in munition factories, and
the Austrian Embassy, in concert with the German,
hoped to see them on the land. After a time the Yugoslavs
took an office in Washington and attacked this
propaganda, their example being followed by the Czechs
and the Poles. When the United States entered the
War these Austrophil papers no longer wrote in favour
of Austria, but confined themselves to animadversions
against the Serbian leaders, suggesting likewise that
Croatia and Slovenia should be independent.... The
patriotic Yugoslav papers&mdash;three dailies in New York,
three in Chicago, and over twenty weekly organs&mdash;were
not subsidized by the Yugoslav Committee in London or
by the Government in Corfu; and some of the editors
did not display a very prosperous appearance. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
poor Yugoslav workers contributed 20 million dollars
to the first three Liberty loans, and when the National
Council at Pittsburg in November 1916 united the
different charitable, gymnastic and political associations,
a call was made for volunteers. Between 25,000-30,000
men joined the United States army, a good many joined
the Canadian contingents, and about 10,000 sailed for
Salonica. The Yugoslavs in South America were in
different circumstances: the Dalmatian temperament
being nearer to the Spanish they found it easier to make
their way; besides which, those who went to South America
were on the average more advanced than those who
preferred the North. In Chili, the Argentine and Bolivia
the Yugoslavs are often very prosperous merchants and
shipowners. They organized the Yugoslav National
Defence and found all the funds for the Yugoslav organization
in London. From New Zealand, where there is a
Yugoslav paper called <i>Zora</i> (the <i>Dawn</i>), about 300 volunteers
sailed to the Dardanelles, and others, when the
Salonica base was established, joined their compatriots in
that port.</p>


<p class="section">CASH AND THE MONTENEGRIN ROYAL FAMILY</p>

<p>While the distant Yugoslavs were, in one way or
another, helping the cause, that family of criminals which
reigned in Montenegro did not shrink from malversation
of the funds of the Red Cross. A young Croat, Mr.
Mili&#269;evi&#263;, who before the War became a naturalized Montenegrin
and in Neuilly served as Minister of Justice, has
related how the Government continually borrowed (and
did not repay) large sums of Red Cross money, and that if
new clothes came from England for the refugees they
would in Paris be replaced quite often for much older
ones. How did the people fare? After the country had
been occupied by the Austrians, most of the Allies consented
that it should be revictualled on the same lines
as Belgium. Even Austria offered no objections. One
State only and one man were hostile to the scheme, and
that man actually the King of Montenegro. "A poor
and starving people," he argued, "is the most subservient.
My interests will suffer if commodities are given to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Montenegrins. Let them wait. And when the moment
comes for my return, I will go back with large supplies
and be most popular." Even when his Ministers had
realized that there must be no more delay in asking for
the King of Spain's good offices&mdash;since the Italians (presumably
in concert with Nikita) fought against the plan&mdash;and
when the letter to the King of Spain was drafted it
produced another one from Nikita to his Ministers&mdash;written
by Nikita, but signed by his aide-de-camp. "The
King," he said, "considers that the letter to the King of
Spain should stand over, so long as one cannot be sure
that Italy will permit the transit of foodstuffs destined
for the people." He desired no mediation between himself
and the Italians. Perhaps the most audacious act
of spoliation was the sale of the State stores at Gallipoli,
just when the Allied offensive on the Salonica front was
leading to the collapse of the enemy. Instead of forwarding
the 25,000 greatcoats, the 20,000 kilos of leather,
and great quantities of material, medical and other stores,
to Montenegro and rendering first aid to the liberated
population, the managers of the Royal Treasury deemed
it wiser to transfer the value of all these stores into their
own pockets, disposing of more than 2-1/2 million francs worth
of goods to trusted figureheads for a few hundred thousand
Italian lire. Fortunately the French naval authorities
put a stop to this brigandage, and the honest guardians
of the people only succeeded in diverting a few hundreds
of thousands. You may suppose that there is no excuse
for conduct of this kind; but the Royal Family could
say, "Behold, the people do not want our gifts." The
Montenegrins, for example, who were interned at Karlstein
in Austria, where they were not overfed, sent a
telegram on November 27, 1916, to ask at whose initiative
the Red Cross parcels had been sent to them. This was
(in German) the prepaid reply: "Montenegrin Committee,
President, Professor Pugnet, supported by the Red
Cross. (Signed) <span class="smcap">The Bakery</span>." As Pugnet was Danilo's
professor, all the interned, except six or seven, declined
the parcels.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Among the half-dozen were some relatives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of Nikita, and some who explained that "We take
the traitor's bread, for otherwise we should die; and
after all it is the Entente which sends it. How unfortunate
for us that they regard Nikita as our King." After the
Armistice Nikita and his adherents complained bitterly
that the Podgorica Assembly which deposed him was
convened before these internees had come back from
Austria!</p>

<p>Although the funds of the Montenegrin Red Cross
were, as we have seen, not devoted to the needs of many
of the Montenegrins, yet the Royal Family were very
energetic in collecting cash. They caused a letter to be
written to the French Red Cross, which had collected two
millions for the Serbs, and in the letter they asked for
a part of the two millions. A diplomatic answer was
received. "You are only working," it said, "for Montenegro,
whereas we are for all the Yugoslavs." This lack
of success in financial matters was a new experience for
the Royal House. When Russia sent the Montenegrin
officers their pay during the War, an arrangement was
made for it to come <i>via</i> Serbia in Serbian dinars. The
King of Montenegro kept the dinars and paid his officers
in paper money. Later on he sold such enormous quantities
of dinars on the Paris Bourse that the Serbian Minister,
Mr. Vesni&#263;, had to protest. One remembers the haste
with which Nikita left his country&mdash;both his people and
his army he forgot, but not his gold. And for two years
in France he struggled to get into his own hands this
bullion which belonged to the State. Apparently he
did at last receive it when he was at Pau in 1918. He
was granted, for the expenses of his Court, a monthly
allowance of 100,000 francs by Great Britain, the same
by France, and 300,000 by Italy, which latter was not
registered in the books. It would be interesting to know
how much of this money was used for objects that Great
Britain and France would never have countenanced.
Virulent anti-Serbian newspapers were published in
Switzerland&mdash;the <i>Srpski List</i>, the <i>Na&#353;a Borba</i> and the
<i>Nova Srbija</i>. The tone of these papers was so pleasing
to the Austrians that they bought up large numbers and
distributed them throughout the Southern Slav lands
they were occupying. We are, therefore, not astonished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
that the British subsidy came to an end in the course of
1917; to be resumed, however, in 1918 and finally stopped
in June 1919, much to the indignation of Nikita and his
partisans, who pointed out that it had been decided in
Paris in the beginning of the War that the little nations
participating in it should be helped pecuniarily. France
stopped her payment four months after England and
said, in answer to a Montenegrin Note, that if Great
Britain resumed payment they would follow her example.
Pa&#353;i&#263; asked that the subsidies should be discontinued,
thus reducing "this little country to such a state of
despair," said Mr. Ronald M'Neill in the House of Commons
in November 1919, "and to strip it so naked before the
world that it will be compelled, having no other course
to take, to accept union with Serbia, as the only way out
of hopeless misery and bankruptcy." It is possible that
Mr. M'Neill is referring to some subsidy other than that
given to Nikita, but I have my doubts. In the same
speech he alluded to American Relief work in Montenegro,
saying that 70 per cent. of it was consumed by Serbian
troops and the rest sold to profiteers. He confused the
American Red Cross, which maintained four hospitals
and distributed vast quantities of clothing and food
among the inhabitants of Montenegro, and those American
supplies which the Yugoslav Government purchased,
mainly for the troops. But Mr. M'Neill, M.P., is very
angry with the Serbs for spreading, as he says, reports
discreditable to the King of Montenegro&mdash;if he knew a
little more I think that he would say a good deal less&mdash;and
Nikita must have deprecated the remark that no
facilities at all had been given by the Great Powers to
enable him and his Ministers to return to Montenegro. If
every Serbian soldier were to be withdrawn the country
would, with a tremendous majority, have been adverse to
the ex-King and his family. This was recognized by Danilo
when his father suggested that he should go out in the
autumn of 1918. On December 5 he replied from Cap
Martin saying that the appendicitis from which he had
suffered since the War prevented him even from going
into the garden. Mr. M'Neill and a few similar enthusiasts
are not weary of repeating that the Serbs and the Montenegrins
are quite distinct peoples. This, no doubt, is Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
M'Neill's opinion, and if he wishes to retain it he is welcome
to do so. But I should like to refer his audiences in the
House of Commons and elsewhere to the Patriarch Brki&#263;
of Pe&#263;, who wrote in the eighteenth century concerning
some of the Turkish provinces. No one would pretend
that Brki&#263; was profoundly versed in philology or in
ethnography, and I believe he studied the Slav languages
not any more than does Mr. M'Neill. He was a Montenegrin
whose education had been that of an ordinary
pupil in a monastery. He spoke the Southern dialect,
and in his eyes all those who had another accent were not
veritable Serbs. Even in our time there are many Montenegrins
whom it is quite difficult to convince that they are
not the only true Serbs.</p>


<p class="section">THE BURDEN OF AUSTRIA'S SOUTHERN SLAV TROOPS</p>

<p>Meanwhile Austria's Yugoslav soldiers and sailors had
been continuing their patriotic work. On February 2,
1918, a telegram was sent to the Army High Command
at Baden (near Vienna). [This message is No. 974. It
concerns itself with the Austrian navy, in whose ranks
Sarkoti&#263; perceives agitation. The rest of the message
consists chiefly of the drastic remedies which the writer
would apply.]</p>

<p>There follows a document, numbered 106,116, and
dated May 5, 1918, in which the disaffection of Slovene
troops is described. Not only have anti-dynastic ones
been raised, but a N.C.O. has torn off his two Austrian
decorations and has stamped on them, while troops have
worn their national colours in their caps, though this is
only authorized when they are marching to a battlefield.</p>

<p>In a notice on the subject of Southern Slav and Italian
propaganda in Dalmatia, the military command at Mostar
denounces the Southern Slavs, officers and men:</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%; text-indent: 0em">
<span class="smcap">Imperial and Royal Army: Higher Command.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 5em"><i>Chief of the General Staff.</i></span><br />
Op. No. 109,942.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 16em"><span class="smcap">Baden</span>, <i>August</i> 5, 1918.</span></p>

<p>[After discussing various manifestations of disloyalty,
the writer says that he has observed how there is a kind
of link between the Slav officers, educated at the Academy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and their men. He finds that Spalato is particularly
given to these Southern Slav ideas, which he believes is
to be accounted for from the fact that Dr. Trumbi&#263;, "the
celebrated agitator," is mayor and deputy of that town.]</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1em">So much for the complaints with regard to Austria-Hungary's
Southern Slav soldiers. Two military courts
of justice sat at Zagreb through the War, the Imperial
and Royal Court, and that of the Royal Hungarian No. 6
(Croatian-Slavonian) Honved Division. No statistics are
to hand with reference to the various courts in Syrmia,
and that one which earned such an evil reputation in the
fortress of Peterwardein. The judgments of the two
Zagreb courts, where Croat officers were able to make
their influence felt, did not appear to the authorities of
Vienna and Buda-Pest to be sufficiently drastic. No
death sentences were pronounced, although these had
been demanded; and on June 24, 1918, it was decided
that any further trials for high treason or for offences
against the military authorities should be held in Pressburg
(Bratislava) and not in Zagreb. The following
statistics, relating to the two Zagreb courts, were compiled
from the official books which the Austrians did not remove.
The figures shown opposite, which are certified by Captain
Sto&#382;ir, Provost-Marshal, show the increasing determination
to risk everything rather than to fight for Austria.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to give some details of one of
the regiments whose composition was chiefly Slav. My
informant, Dr. Ivo Yelavi&#263;, served as telephone officer
on the staff of the 37th Dalmatian Regiment. At different
times&mdash;at the fall of Gorica, in December 1916 at Sanmarco,
and in June 1917 at Tolmein, three battalions
went over to the enemy; 170 officers (of whom 169 were
reserve officers) gave themselves up during the War.
Some of them were Serbs, most were Croats. With
respect to the fall of Gorica, this was not&mdash;despite the
clamour that they made about it&mdash;due to the Italians, but
to two officers, Tolja and Salvi, who took over with them all
the plans of the underground forts and maps made to the
scale of one step to a millimetre. Among the accomplishments
which the officers of this regiment taught their men
was how to surrender to the foe. Efforts were made to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>bring about a different state of things: German and
Magyar regiments were placed behind it, with machine
guns; the regiment itself was filled up with Magyars.
On some occasions the 37th desisted from going over in
order not to bring persecution upon their homes. In 1914,
opposite the Montenegrins at Gora&#382;da, all the plans were
worked out, but at the last moment Dr. Count Gozze (of
Dubrovnik) said he had just thought of what would happen
to their families, and they refrained. After the battalion
had gone over in 1916 General Seidler told them he would
do his best to have the regiment dissolved and the men
divided among other regiments, but that not all the officers
would go. This was an ominous hint that he intended
to decimate them, after the fashion of Field-Marshal
Liposcak. A fortnight later, in the presence of Field-Marshal
Boroevi&#263;, General Wurm and General Seidler,
they were highly praised; and when they, in company
with a Magyar regiment, took Hill No. 166, it was announced
that this had been achieved by the "fame-covered
regiment," which was done to throw dust in the
eyes of the Italians and the Entente. Various other
methods were used to escape service at the front. A Slav
doctor, whose hospital at Konjica could hold 400 patients,
used to have 4000-5000 on the books; those whom he was
unable to keep he gave convalescent leave. In this way
he saved a great many of the Dalmatian <i>intelligentsia</i>. He
and another Dalmatian doctor would send the men backwards
and forwards, now to one hospital, now to another.
One ordinary method for avoiding the front was to bribe
the company commander and the N.C.O. who made out
the lists. Yet sometimes there was no help for it. When,
for instance, in September 1914 they were at Banjaluka,
the enemy advanced to Pal&eacute;, very near Sarajevo. My
informant has a vivid recollection of the way in which a
Viennese captain, the leader of the contingent, trembled.
In a Bosnian valley they met a woman with five small
children, one of whom was at her breast. The captain
told my acquaintance (who was then a N.C.O.) to stay
behind with some men and shoot her, but not to let him
hear anything. He said that the General at Sarajevo
had commanded that everything Serb that goes on two
legs must be cut down. Yelavi&#263; refused to carry out this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
order, whereupon the captain told Dr. Gozze, whom he
greatly disliked, that he must do it. Gozze stayed behind,
fired a few shots in the air and informed the captain that
everything was over.</p>

<p>What the Austrian command really thought of the
37th Regiment, and of others, may be seen from a report
dated December 2, 1916, and signed by the Archduke
Frederick:</p>

<p>"... Certain events that have occurred can be
explained only as the consequences of the weak attitude of
the authorities towards the traitorous propaganda. On
July 21, five soldiers of the 23rd Regiment deserted near
Pogger, and gave the Italian Command important information
regarding movements of troops and the course of the
fighting near Gorica. Quite recently a lieutenant, two
reserve officers, two N.C.O.'s and two soldiers deserted
from the 37th Regiment, as did three soldiers from the
23rd Regiment. Since April, 244 desertions have taken
place from the two regiments. Inquiry shows that these
desertions occur regularly and immediately after the return
of the soldiers from leave. Unless effective counter-measures
are adopted it will be impossible to utilize these
Dalmatian regiments."</p>

<p>It was not always an easy operation to surrender, even
after one had reached the Italian lines. A friend of mine
went over with another officer and eight men. In the
first-line trenches they could see no one and felt uncertain
what to do. However, they proceeded, and from the
second-line trench their whispered calls were answered.
They were made to pass in single file, holding up their
hands, and with all the available weapons held in readiness
against them. My friend, at his request, was conducted
to the colonel, and the first thing that he did was to make
a formal complaint against the way in which this army, of
which he considered himself an ally, manned its front-line
trenches.</p>

<p>The Yugoslavs who managed to escape to Russia
volunteered for service and, after being organized by
General Zivkovi&#263; at Odessa, formed the two Divisions
which, as is well known, did remarkable work in the
Dobrudja. One only has to hear what the Bulgars say
about them. In the battles round Constanza, during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
campaign of 1916, one of these Divisions was so frequently
engaged in the most arduous positions and had such
enormous losses that it was regarded as having been
wiped out. When the Roumanian troops retreated these
Yugoslavs found themselves encircled by the Bulgarian
and German armies; they hacked a way out with their
bayonets. The higher officers had come from Serbia, the
rest of them had previously been enrolled in Austria's
army. Thirty-two officers out of 500 were killed, while
300 were wounded; and of the 42,000 men 1939 were
killed and more than 8000 were wounded. Nevertheless
the <i>morale</i> remained excellent and there was no lack of
new volunteers. "Verily," as the Serbian proverb says,
"it does not snow to kill the beasts, but in order that they
may leave their traces."</p>


<p class="section">THE FAITHFUL ITALIANS</p>

<p>Now let us see what Austria's Italian subjects achieved
in the War, basing ourselves less upon the post-war declarations
of some Istrian, Trentino and Dalmatian Italians
than upon the official Austrian reports that were sent
about these gentlemen to the Government during the
War. For example:</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%; text-indent: 0em">

<span style="padding-left: 5em">the Interior, Vienna.</span></span><br />

<span style="padding-left: 16em"><span class="smcap">Knin</span>, <i>June</i> 25, 1915.</span><br /></p>

<p class="center">
<i>I permit myself to notify:</i>
</p>

<p>[Herein the Statthalter, Graf Attems, praises his
Government for not having favoured one party more than
another at Zadar. He proceeds to testify to the admirable
conduct of Dr. Ziliotto, the well-known mayor (who subsequently
toiled with such zeal for Italy). He says
that under this gentleman Zadar was a very model of a
place, never allowing an occasion to pass by when it was
possible to show that, in grief and in gladness, the sentiments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of the glorious House of Habsburg were its own.
Thus on the "all-highest" birthday of the Emperor did
the doctor and his townsfolk revel in loyalty, while at the
outbreak of the Great War they accompanied the departing
troops to the quay and provided patriotic music and
refreshments. <i>This worthy conduct was not in the least
modified</i>, says the Statthalter, <i>when Italy entered the War</i>.]</p>

<p>Further on in this book there are similar good-conduct
testimonials from Split, where the chief Italian used to
wander down with an Austrian official to the harbour and
there witness the embarkation, in chains, of the Yugoslav
<i>intelligentsia</i> who were being taken as hostages. Hundreds
and hundreds of Yugoslavs were shot, hanged, imprisoned;
we know the numbers (not difficult to count) of the
Italians in Dalmatia who suffered in any way. We know
the equally minute numbers who escaped to Italy and
enrolled themselves in the Italian army. As for the
population of the Italian irredentist provinces, one may
read in the <i>Secolo</i> of August 11, 1916 how it became generally
known that "with the exception of Cervignano and
Monfalcone, our soldiers have been received, on the other
side of the old frontier, with demonstrations quite the
reverse of enthusiastic on the part of the agrarian population.
The surprise and disillusion of our troops were very
great, for they expected from our unredeemed brothers,
who all speak our language, a joyous reception." This
frigidity may, however, have been due to the influence of
Austrian priests and gendarmes. What are we to say,
though, when we come to the more enlightened classes?
The Italians in Austria were represented by twelve
deputies who were devoted to the Austrian Government
and hostile to Italy, and by six national-liberals and one
socialist who were animated with pro-Italian sentiments.
In electing such deputies, however, the peasants may not
have simply allowed the priests and the gendarmes to
command them; it is also possible that they were moved
by the fear that the Trentino would economically be
ruined if it were to become Italian and had to compete with
the agricultural products of the Kingdom. As a matter
of fact it was the Trentino <i>intelligentsia</i> which looked
forward to annexation, and not, as a class, the peasants.
And, during the War, Italian deputies of various parties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
overflowed with loyal Austrian sentiments; unlike the
Yugoslav deputies, who refused in a body to vote the
budget and the war credits, the Italian deputies never
even ventured on a national pronouncement. Pittoni,
chief of the Italian socialists at Triest, Faidutti (who was
born in Italy) and Bugatto, the chiefs of the Italian
Catholic party of Gradi&#353;ca, uttered not a few words of hate
against the Madre Patria. The Italians praise always,
and with excellent reason, their three heroes: Battisti,
Rismondo and Sauro. But the Yugoslavs, in the course
of the late War, lost in the unredeemed provinces so many
hundreds of thousands who were hanged in Bosnia, who
were dragged away&mdash;centenarians and infants&mdash;to the
prison camps, were spat upon and stoned and treated in
the most barbaric fashion, that they look upon those
Yugoslavs who, like Battisti, fled from Austria and afterwards
were slain by Austrians, as rather to be envied, since
at any rate they struck a blow. But anyhow the names of
all these volunteers could not be celebrated, on account of
their great number. "There is nothing in fact," wired
Mr. Beaumont on December 31, 1919, from Milan for the
blameless readers of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, "there is nothing
that creates such terrible exasperation in Italy as the
persistent repetition of this patent falsehood that the
Yugoslavs&mdash;meaning thereby the Croats&mdash;fought for the
common cause."</p>

<p>Poor Battisti&mdash;when his regiment was captured he
feigned to be dead. His men, however, told the Austrians
that it was he, and this they did because they said that he
and his Irredentist party were to blame for the War.
These facts are now fairly well known, thanks to the Czech
doctor who was on the spot and tried to save him by
assuring the Austrians that it was not Battisti. The
soldiers insisted, and in the end the Austrians executed
him.</p>


<p class="section">SOUTHERN SLAVS IN THE AUSTRIAN NAVY</p>

<p>The several transactions or attempted transactions
which took place at various periods of the War between
the Yugoslav members of the Austro-Hungarian navy,
associated with other Yugoslavs, on the one hand and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Italian authorities on the other, were frustrated time and
again by the astounding conduct of the Italians. Had
they made anything like a proper use of the invaluable
information that was showered upon them or if they had
requested the other Allied navies in the Mediterranean
to act on their behalf many Allied ships in the Mediterranean
would not have been torpedoed&mdash;since the submarine
activity centred at Kotor, one of the stations which
could have been seized&mdash;the Austrian front in Albania
must have collapsed and the entire war would have ended
sooner.</p>

<p>In October 1917 the Austrian torpedo boat No. 11 was
seized by the Slav members of her crew and brought into
Ancona, but their offers of service were refused. The
ringleaders showed, by refusing to accept large sums of
money, that their purpose was purely patriotic. The
Italians, however, simply interned them.</p>

<p>A much more serious affair was that of February 1,
1918, on which day it had been arranged that the Slav
sailors at Pola and Kotor should mutiny. At the former
place it did not succeed, at Kotor it was so far successful
that the mutineers, after imprisoning Admiral Njegovan
and many other officers whom they suspected of not being
in sympathy with them, took command of the ships and
left unanswered an ultimatum addressed to them by the
High Naval Command. There was a prospect of the
whole fleet shaking off the Austro-Hungarian authority.
The chief revolutionary leader was Ante Sesan, a Croat
ensign, twenty-six years of age, from near Dubrovnik and
the son of a well-known sea captain on the coast. "We
drew up," he says, "a proclamation representing our case
to the Yugoslavs, Czechs and Poles from the national
point of view, and to the Germans and Magyars from the
socialist point of view. The Germans threw in their lot
with us, but the Magyars went against us. From our ship
we continually sent wireless messages asking for help
from the Entente fleet, and at first from Italy which
was nearest and could help most quickly. The messages
were continually jammed by sailors at the Ercegnovo
station loyal to Austria-Hungary, but nevertheless it
was known in Italy that something was happening at
Kotor. We told the High Command at Bok Kotor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
(Bocche di Cattaro) that we no longer recognized their
authority and asked that we might get into touch with
our deputies, whom alone we recognized. The High
Command consented. We wired for the following
deputies to come to us: Tre&#353;i&#263; (Yugoslav), Stanjek
(Czech), Karolyi (Magyar), Adler (German) and one
Polish deputy, but our wires did not, for the most part,
get through. Our object was to get help, but meanwhile
our situation became more and more desperate. We
knew that the Third Division was coming from Pola
against us, and also the army in Herzegovina. We were
prepared to take the battery of the Punta d'Ostro, the most
important battery and the key to Bok Kotor, which was
in the hands of sailors inimical to us. The news came
from Gaa that the Magyars there had got the upper hand.
We tried to bring them over to us, but in vain. They said,
'If you don't stop this, we shall join the Third Division
and take action against you.' The Magyars from other
boats sent the same message. The Council of Sailors then
debated what was to be done, and it was suggested that
Rasha (who was shot later) should go in a hydroplane to
Italy to give information on the situation and ask for help,
and that we in the meantime should lie low, and in the
event of help coming, again raise a revolt. Rasha objected
that he did not know Italian, and proposed that
I should go. The Third Division meanwhile was already
in the port Bok Kotor.</p>

<p>"At half-past eight in the morning we flew away in
the hydroplane to Italy, I and two Poles. At ten we
reached Mattinato, and I explained at the Carabineers'
station why I had come and asked to be brought as soon
as possible before the Commander of the District. Later
I saw Captain Odo (of the Territorials) and told him all, and
asked him to put me into communication with Brindisi,
Taranto or Rome. He had us put under arrest. I was
interviewed by two flying officers two days later, but they
went off to Brindisi in my hydroplane without me.</p>

<p>"On February 17 I was taken under armed escort
to Brindisi, where I was imprisoned in a cabin of the
man-of-war <i>Varese</i>.... I told the commander of the
ship that I was at his disposal with all my knowledge of
the Austrian fleet. I asked him to put questions, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
I did not know how much he knew. It was all to no
purpose. On February 21 the Admiral in command at
Brindisi saw me. From what he said I understood that
nothing had been done about Bok Kotor and, what was
more, that not one hydroplane had been sent to investigate
the situation there. I learned that I was to go to
Rome. They clapped me into barracks.... I again
asked the Italians to allow me to speak to the Serbian
Minister, whom I considered the representative of the
Yugoslav people, but the request was refused on the plea
that it was a question of high politics. Meanwhile the
Polish representative Zamorski was allowed to visit
the Poles, but from February 3 to May 25 I was unable to
get into communication with any of our people."</p>

<p>In May there was another outbreak at Kotor, but it
was overpowered, and many Yugoslav sailors were shot
or imprisoned. Sesan was also kept in his Italian prison,
though occasionally he was brought out, questioned and
then taken back again. Thus at Ferrara he informed
Captain Ciano about the whole organization of the
Austrian offensive and defensive forces, and especially
about Pola and Split. Sesan begged to be allowed to take
part in the action against the Austrian fleet, and, at Rome,
where he came before Captain Soldati, of the Bureau of
Information, he made the same request. With two motor
launches he undertook to organize communication between
Italy and the Slavs of Dalmatia, in this way to
follow events in Austria and help the revolutionary movement.
It would be possible to procure the secret wireless
codes which the Austrian and German submarines used&mdash;but
the Italians would do nothing, because they were
not willing to recognize that the Yugoslavs were fighting
against Austria.... Seeing that he would never move
the Italians to take serious action against the Austrian
fleet, Sesan asked to be sent to the Serbian army in
Macedonia, so that at Salonica he could get into touch
with the French and British fleet. In this also he failed,
for he was interned from June till December with Yugoslav
officers at Nocera Umbra. While there he was
visited by Bissolati, from whom he learned that the Chief
of the Admiralty was hostile to the Yugoslavs. And at
Nocera Umbra he remained until December 6, when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
was liberated, owing to the efforts of Trumbi&#263; and other
members of the Yugoslav Committee.</p>

<p>In the month of September a memorandum was drawn
up by Trumbi&#263;, in which he proposed to English and
American political and military circles the landing at
&#352;ibenik of a force of 50,000 men. This would have been
assisted by the mutinous crews of the Austro-Hungarian
Fleet, whose preparations had been completed in July
(at this port 90 per cent. of the sailors of the fleet were
Yugoslavs, and among them there was a strong national
feeling; in fact, if their political leaders had not held them
back, they would have endeavoured in July to blow up
the naval fortifications and sail with the ships to Corfu).
The expeditionary army, once at &#352;ibenik, could have
penetrated inland and, acting in consort with the many
Yugoslav deserters and the insurgent population of Dalmatia
and Bosnia, have accelerated the Austrian <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>.
In this memorandum Trumbi&#263; asked that the combined
Anglo-American-French fleet should support the action,
but that the Italians, whom the Yugoslavs distrusted,
should take no part. He sneered at the cowardice of
the Italians who, with a huge army, did not dare to start
an offensive on a grand scale.</p>

<p>[In well-informed circles in Italy this memorandum
was already known, but when it was read in the Italian
Chamber in the spring of 1919 it made a considerable
sensation.]</p>

<p>On October 3, Messrs. Frederick &#352;tepanek, Rudolph
Giunio, Valentine Zi&#263; (of &#352;ibenik) and other authorized
Czecho-Slovak and Yugoslav emissaries went in a sailing-boat
from Vis to Italy, with a view to getting into connection
with Dr. Bene&#353; (afterwards the Czecho-Slovak
Foreign Minister) and Dr. Trumbi&#263;, to inform them as to
the situation in the Monarchy and to obtain instructions
regarding the moment of the revolution in which their
soldiers and sailors were to participate. On arrival in
Rome on October 7, the delegates were interrogated by
Major Trojani of the Bureau of Information and on the
same day for three hours by the Inspector-General of
Public Safety. From then till October 20, they were
interned in the Macoa barracks at the Castro Pretoris,
and although they made repeated attempts to see a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
member of the Yugoslav Committee or Dr. Bene&#353;, who was
in Rome, they were told that this "delicate" question
could only be solved by the Premier himself; and when
brought before him Dr. Bene&#353; had departed. The delegates
had entreated that he and Trumbi&#263; should be
informed of their arrival, but in spite of various assurances
nothing whatever was done. It is suggested that the
fleet would have been in Slav hands two or three weeks
earlier, which would very probably have precipitated
events on the Western front, if the Italians had not acted
in this inexcusable fashion.</p>


<p class="section">ADVANCE OF THE ALLIES IN MACEDONIA</p>

<p>The collapse of Austria-Hungary was being hastened
by the fine work of the Allies' Macedonian army. France
and Great Britain had provided for the re-equipment of
the Serbs. And of the variegated forces that were based
on Salonica none did more magnificently than this resurrected
army. A weather-beaten sergeant of the French
Infanterie Coloniale told me that he had never seen an
exploit such as that of Kaimat&#269;alan, where the Serbs set
themselves the task of climbing to the summit, which
towers 8000 feet high, and from there dislodging the
Bulgarian artillery. Over and over again the Serbs
were thrown back, and with terrific losses, for the mountain-side
was strewn with rocks not large enough to
shelter more than a man or two. But as the Infanterie
Coloniale is habitually chosen for the roughest work,
so the Serbs asked for nothing better than to climb the
wall that shut them out from their own country. The
labyrinth of trenches on the mountain-top was taken
and retaken many times, until the Bulgars&mdash;inadequately
supported by their Allies&mdash;had to retreat; and this,
after further ferocious fighting, enabled the Serbs and
the French to liberate Monastir. The complicated story
of Greek man&oelig;uvres need not detain us, nor need we ask
whether Mr. Leland Buxton<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> is justified in saying that
the majority of that people were pro-German, "but were
subsequently compelled by the Allied blockade ... to
declare themselves supporters of Venizelos, on whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
behalf, indeed, the British Admiralty and War Office
had to carry on a sort of election campaign (by Eastern
European methods) until the numerous waverers wisely
decided that it was better to be a well-fed Venizelist than
a hungry Royalist." Sufficient that after months of
delaying, in the course of which the Russian troops had
to be turned into labour battalions, Marshal Mi&#353;i&#263;&mdash;whose
plan of campaign had fortunately been adopted&mdash;had the
satisfaction of seeing his own countrymen and their Allies
racing up at last through Macedonia and Serbia to the
Danube and beyond it.... What did they find?
Bridges hastily blown up, tunnels rendered impassable
by two locomotives laden with dynamite being made to
collide in the middle of them&mdash;but the Serbs went rushing
on. The supply columns could not keep pace with the
troops&mdash;during the first eight days of the offensive the
men of the 2nd Army received but two days' rations&mdash;they
continued their advance across the Vardar, though
but little bread and practically no other food was obtainable.
In three days they had covered sixty miles. There
was only time for them to greet the women and old men&mdash;and
even if they had then been told of the 130,000 horses,
the 6,000,000 sheep and goats, the 2,000,000 pigs, 1,300,000
cattle and over 8,000,000 poultry which the enemy had
taken; if they had learned that the losses sustained by
Serbia&mdash;exclusive of her own expenses and of the war loans
from her Allies&mdash;amounted to some 10,000,000,000 frs.
on a pre-war valuation, what did all this matter in that
joyous time?</p>


<p class="section">HOW THE MAGYARS TREATED THEIR SERBIAN SUBJECTS</p>

<p>At the beginning of the War the dominant Magyars
of the Banat had as little uncertainty about the result
as Count Julius Andr&aacute;ssy professed to have at a later
period. "Victory must come to our troops," he said,
"because they are better organized and more efficient,
and because they are, above all, filled with unexampled
enthusiasm, which makes heroes of them all." The
enthusiasm which, for instance, caused the mob at Velika
Kikinda to shout "Eljen a haboru!" ["Long live the
War!"] while they fired revolvers in at the windows of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
an unilluminated house because it was the house of a
Serb, a son-in-law of the well-known banker, Marko
Bogdan, without stopping to ascertain that he was at
the front fighting against Serbia, might be dismissed as a
folly on the part of the crowd if it were not so characteristic
of the whole Magyar administration. The "subject
nationalities" were to be enrolled in the Magyar host
and treated, at the same time, with contumely. At
Ver&#353;ac Dr. Slavko Mileti&#263;,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> son of the famous patriot, was
suspected not only of cherishing Serbian sympathies,
which was natural, but of committing a felony. The
authorities believed that in his medical capacity he was
exempting people from their military service, and not
for the advantage of the Serbian cause so much as for
that of his own pocket. Several detectives were therefore
put to bed in one or two of the wards of the military
hospital; and the upshot of it was that three other
doctors&mdash;all of them Magyars&mdash;who had given way to
these practices, committed suicide; the chief of the
hospital poisoned himself, one of the staff shot himself,
and the third culprit hanged himself in prison. Dr.
Mileti&#263; had previously been kept for three and a half months
under the shadow of a conviction for high treason: one
Bonchocat, a Roumanian who did not understand the
Serbian language, asserted that the doctor, at a meeting
held two weeks before the Archduke's assassination, must
have known that war was brewing, since&mdash;so said Bonchocat&mdash;he
had not confined himself to Serbian ecclesiastical
affairs, which was the object of the meeting, but had
uttered the remark that if the Austrians had bayonets
the Serbs had axes. Although Bonchocat was a man
condemned to nine years' penal servitude for murder, and
although the doctor only called on his own behalf two
witnesses who were not Serbs, but the head of the frontier
police and the head of the town police, he was nevertheless
kept in suspense for three and a half months. Afterwards,
owing to the lack of Magyar doctors, he was begged to be
the State doctor for the town. Similarly the Orthodox
priest, Radulovi&#263;, of Pan&#269;evo, was transported to Arad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and interned there for no other reason than his nationality,
whereas his son, a first lieutenant of the Hungarian Honved,
was expected to be very loyal. When certain rumours
came to the son's ears&mdash;he was then serving on the Russian
front&mdash;he inquired, and was told that his father had
merely been warned. Presently he learned the truth, and
in consequence deserted to the Russians and became a
member of the Yugoslav brigade. Thus it will be seen
that the Magyar unwisdom was on a par with that which
they had shown in days of peace. Unfortunately for
their State the Magyar politicians were less honest than
the Magyar peasants, so that the de-nationalizing process
met with pretty firm resistance. What can be said for
the honesty of a legal decision which laid it down that as
two Serbian philanthropists, Barajevac and Sandulovi&#263;,
at Pan&#269;evo had not specially mentioned that the funds
they had bequeathed for a school were to be for a Serbian
school&mdash;(this the benefactors had assumed as a matter
of course)&mdash;they must be used for a Magyar establishment?
Save for the officials there were practically no Magyars
in Pan&#269;evo. And when the War began the remainder
of the fund was invested by the Magyars in their War
Loan! It is curious, by the way, to see what methods
were employed to make the Loan successful. Fathers
were frequently told that if their subscription was adequate
their sons at the front would duly be granted leave. The
Slovak village of Kova&#269;ica in the Banat was compelled
to put three million crowns into War Loan, the Magyar
notary making a list of the amounts which every person
had to pay under penalty of being sent to the front; if
he was too old for this he was threatened with internment.
Kova&#269;ica, a few years before the War, had shown
the Magyar fitness for governing an alien people. The
population consisted of 5200 Lutheran Slovaks and 200
miscellaneous persons&mdash;Jews, Magyars and Germans.
Nevertheless it was ordered that the church services must
be in the Magyar and not in the Slovak language. When
the parishioners objected, the police, with sticks and
guns, expelled them from the large, lofty church, and
83 of them were sentenced to various periods of imprisonment.
Serbian barristers defended them gratuitously,
but the judge had himself taken an active part in turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the people out of the church; and presently the barristers
were told that they had themselves been convicted&mdash;Dr.
Du&#353;an Bo&#353;covi&#263; for one year, on the ground that he had
had the napkins at a banquet decorated with the Serbian
colours; Dr. Branislav Stanojevi&#263; for three years, because
his visits to Belgrade, where his parents and his brother
were living, stamped him, said the Magyar judge, as a
traitor. The total number of Magyars at Kova&#269;ica was
ten, and for a time they came to hear their language,
which had thus been compulsorily introduced. Handbills
were sent round to summon the Magyars from neighbouring
villages, but gradually this congregation grew
smaller and smaller. When two Magyars attended,
then the pastor gave them a sermon; if only one was
present he confined himself to prayers. The Magyars
had seen to it, by the way, that there should not be much
sympathy between the pastor and his bishop: of this
diocese about three-quarters were Slovaks and one-quarter
Germans and Magyars; but the Government vetoed the
choice of Dr. Czalva, who was disqualified for being friendly
to the Slovaks&mdash;his father and grandfather had both been
bishops of that same diocese&mdash;and a certain Dr. Raffay
was appointed, who spoke nothing but Magyar and some
words of German.... However, by taking in this way
a few examples of Magyar methods, one may be accused
of having chosen merely those which illustrate one's
theme. It would be hazardous to draw conclusions as
to Magyar officers in general because a certain Lieutenant
Chaby, who, during the War, found himself quartered on
a Serbian family of the name of Stejvovi&#263; at Priboj in
the Sandjak, behaved differently from his predecessor,
an Austrian colonel. This Austrian had been well
satisfied, but the lieutenant's first night was so disturbed
that he fined his hosts sixty crowns for giving him a bug-ridden
bed. Nevertheless, if large numbers of Austrian
colonels and Magyar lieutenants had acted in a similar
fashion we should be justified in deducing that several
characteristics, be they good or bad, are possessed by the
average Magyar subaltern. And the catalogue of Magyar
limitations in the Banat, both prior to and during the
War, is so voluminous that one would have thought them
to be not worth discussing; if one restricts oneself to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
few it is in order to avoid being tedious, and if they are
ineffective among the resolute pro-Magyars of this country,
then one must resign oneself to leaving these gentlemen
unconvinced. They will argue that stupidity is universal,
and that the Magyar authorities should not be called in
question for their treatment of the priest of Crvna Crkva,
a village with 1108 inhabitants&mdash;1048 Serbs, 34 Slovaks,
17 Germans and 9 Magyars. This intelligent man&mdash;he is
a noted player of a complicated card game&mdash;was indicted
for high treason, because on hearing that the Emperor
William was alleged to have undertaken to slaughter
every Serb, the priest remarked that the Emperor should
have added, "if God wills it." But near the village of
Zlatica there was, at the beginning of the War, one Adam
Rada, who was charged with making signals to the Serbs
across the Danube by means of lights, and this although
the situation of Rada's mill made such a thing impossible.
Before being executed he was led ceremoniously through
the village, his coffin being carried in the procession.
This coffin was so small that Rada's feet had to be cut
off. The grave was guarded by a soldier, who kept the
family away from it; Rada's servant was in the hands
of the police&mdash;after having been thrashed in order to
compel him to give hostile evidence, he was convicted
to six years' imprisonment. But the lack of evidence
does not appear to have weighed very strongly with the
Magyar judges. "It is quite true," said one of them in
1915 in the town of Bela Crkva, during the trial of a young
priest, Voyn Voynovi&#263;, "that there are witnesses who say
he did not utter certain words in 1913, and no witnesses
who say that he did; but I am convinced that he uttered
them." The ferocity of the punishments may be seen
from the example of Alexa Petkovi&#263; of Pan&#269;evo, the father
of nine, who was condemned to hard labour for nine years
because his twelve-year-old son, during the War, is
alleged to have said to him: "Father, don't accept
German money; it won't have any value." At the same
place, in 1914, the Serbian peasants were brought in from
the village of Bort&#353;a; there was no proof that they were
traitors, but they had been denounced and they were
sentenced to be shot. With a military escort they were
promenaded through the town, each one of them having to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
hold a Hungarian flag. At the scene of execution the
Hungarian &eacute;lite, together with their wives and daughters,
were assembled. And after the bodies had been thrown
on to a cart they were flogged, for some unknown reason,
by one Blajek, a detective, while the audience cried
"Eljen!" ["Hurrah!"]. But the War brought to an
end the bad old days of a tyrannous minority. It will be
shown, in a year or two, when a proper census is taken,
that the Magyars were always much more in a minority
than they ever admitted. Instead of nine millions out
of the eighteen millions&mdash;which was the pre-war population
of Hungary&mdash;it will be found that the Magyars themselves
numbered barely six millions, though in their efforts
to obtain recruits they charged only one crown and afterwards
nothing at all for a naturalization paper. The day
has gone by when a father could be interned for being a
Serb, while his son, an assistant notary, was reckoned a
Magyar&mdash;only Magyars being eligible for that office. The
day has gone when the Buda-Pest Government could
order its officials while taking a census to swell the Magyars'
numbers as much as possible: the officials at Subotica
confessed on oath, after the War, that they had received
orders to this effect. One of their practices was to put
down as "uncertain" those Serbian children who were
too young to speak. Even those who were most willing
to be absorbed into magyardom were often indigested:
one finds in the statistics cases of converted Jews who,
being asked to state their religion and nationality, replied
to the former question "Catholic" and to the latter
"Jew."</p>


<p class="section">THE SOUTHERN SLAVS PAY PART OF THEIR DEBT TO
THE HABSBURG MONARCHY</p>

<p>If the practices of Buda-Pest had been less flagrant
one would write of Hungary's decomposition with a certain
sympathy. It is conceivable that in the British Empire
there are anti-British elements whose aims would commonly
be classed by the authorities as "mad ambitions," which
is what Count Apponyi called the separatist tendencies
of the Southern Slavs in Austria-Hungary. But&mdash;may the
platitude be pardoned!&mdash;there is all the difference between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the spirit in which the alien rule of the one government
was, and of the other is, administered. No doubt there
are portions of the British Empire in which a plebiscite
would have the same disintegrating result as it would
have had in most of the regions that have been lopped
from Hungary. We, with our Allies, declined to permit
a plebiscite in Hungary's late territories, since we believed
that the population had overwhelmingly displayed its
wishes at the end of the War; and an Englishman may
hope to escape the charge of hypocrisy if he does not
permit the withholding of a plebiscite from certain of his
fellow-subjects to prevent him from alluding with satisfaction
to those who have been liberated from the sway
of Buda-Pest.</p>


<p class="section">(<i>a</i>) IN SYRMIA</p>

<p>Everywhere the dawn was breaking for the Habsburg's
Southern Slavs. At Vukovar in Syrmia&mdash;to take an
example&mdash;there was formed, as elsewhere, a National
Council. Under Baron Joseph Rajacsich, a grandson of
the Patriarch and&mdash;to all appearances&mdash;a brother of
Falstaff, the Council maintained order until the coming
of the Serbian army. An Austrian naval captain with a
floating arsenal, four steamers and twenty-two drifters, was
held up, as he proposed to sail towards Buda-Pest, by being
told of a battery at Dalja, higher up the Danube. However,
the Vukovar townsfolk, in view of a possible explosion,
begged that the prisoner, who had wept at being stopped,
should be sent on his way. The German harbour-master,
a lieutenant, assured the Baron that he would assist him
if he were allowed to keep his liberty. But he was tempted,
in the middle of a night, to assist two German captains who
were trying to get through, each with a string of drifters.
Rajacsich, whose armed force consisted of forty Serbian
ex-prisoners and fifty of his own workmen&mdash;he armed
them with what he found on the drifters&mdash;had no means
of stopping the German boats. But after telephoning in
vain to the ex-harbour-master, he fired a shot into one of
the boats, which fortunately found the kitchen, and made
such a terrible noise among the pots and pans that the
Germans considered it more prudent to remain. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Baron succeeded in sending back to Belgrade altogether
39 steamers and 217 loaded drifters, which contained
booty, even from the Ukraine, that was valued at about
a milliard crowns; ... but the Austro-Hungarians
managed to get away with a considerable amount of
plunder. The people of Buda-Pest were surprised, on
the morning of November 5, to find the <i>Sophie</i>, one of
the most luxurious passenger steamers on the Danube,
lying at their quay, with her decks groaning under such
a pile of packing-cases and parcels and furniture and all
kinds of objects heaped upon each other as almost to make
the boat unrecognizable. A lieutenant with a dozen
soldiers was sent to investigate, and the captain showed
him an order from the Minister of War, commanding
that the <i>Sophie</i> should take on board the Military Government
in Serbia and transport it to Vienna. But the
Buda-Pest authorities insisted on removing all the articles
whose ownership the passengers were unable to prove;
and it took a whole day to unload the enormous quantities
of flour, leather, clothing, poultry, sugar, fats, etc.
General Rhemen, the former military governor of Serbia,
related that on October 5 he received the order to begin
the military evacuation of Serbia. This was carried on
day by day, and on October 28 it was completed. "We
sent by the railway and by boats," said Colonel Kerchnaive
to the Hungarian journalists, "4000 carloads of
wheat, 10,000 fat oxen, 10,000 transport oxen, 10,000
pigs, 4000 sheep, 15 carloads of wine, 400 carloads of
jam, enormous quantities of wood, of telephone material,
of arms, munitions and 16 million crowns in silver."
Such was the "military evacuation" of Serbia....
And at the beginning of the same month, when the whole
Austro-Hungarian monarchy was in a state of collapse,
Baron Hussarek stood up in the Reichsrath and said
that "the task will arise for the Government carefully
to prepare and inaugurate the difficult but hopeful work
of reconstructing the monarchy on the basis of national
autonomy." The imperturbable Prime Minister announced
that "we shall have to go to work and set our house in
order." But you will say that the Baron was a futile
Mrs. Partington, an isolated antagonist of the inevitable,
and only mentioned here for the sake of dramatic effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Not at all! So far from being laughed at everywhere
as an absurd reactionary he was held in the highest Buda-Pest
circles to be a perilous innovator. He actually spoke
about conciliating the Austro-Hungarian Slavs: not so
Count Tisza. "What is happening in Austria," exclaimed
the grim Calvinist a few months before, "are strange,
grotesque displays of the ridiculous symptoms of the
presumptuous mentality of people of no importance."</p>


<p class="section">(<i>b</i>) IN SLOVENIA</p>

<p>One further example of Southern Slav activity may be
given, as it will show us what was happening among the
pious and industrious Slovenes. It would have been
unnatural if the Clerical party had longed for Austria's
downfall, and a large number of priests would still have
been Austrophil<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> if Dr. Jegli&#263;, the eminent Prince-Bishop
of Ljubljana, had not summoned all the political parties
and caused them to adopt a patriotic Yugoslav attitude.
(His retirement was in consequence demanded; but the
Pope, who asked him for an explanation of the whole
movement, was quite satisfied. Nor would Vienna have
been able to take any serious steps against the Bishop,
seeing that most of the Slovenes were behind him.) But
the small Slovene people could, until November 1, 1918,
offer nothing more than a passive resistance to their
masters. They did not dare to speak Slovene in public.
"What is the easiest language in the world?" was being
asked in Maribor on the 1st of November. It was the
language which so many people had apparently learned
in a single night. The people were Slovenes, the officials<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
were Austrian&mdash;though one or two of the officials were
Slovenes and a minority of the people claimed to be
Austrians, this being more marked in the town of Maribor
(where the German-Austrians were as many as 35 per
cent.) than in the surrounding district (where 95 per cent.
are Yugoslav). Dr. Jegli&#263; had prepared the forces that
were going to break their bonds on that fateful day. At
7 a.m. Dr. Sre&#269;ko Lajn&#353;i&#263;&mdash;one of the rare Slovene
officials&mdash;he had been denounced by two of his colleagues and
imprisoned at the beginning of the War, for having, as
they said, "laughed maliciously" at Great Britain
resolving to fight&mdash;Dr. Lajn&#353;i&#263; and his friend General
Maister took over the administration in the name of the
Yugoslav State. General Maister had been till then a
Major, employed&mdash;as he was a political suspect&mdash;on d&eacute;p&ocirc;t
work. And when the eight or nine Austrian colonels
appeared on November 1 before Lajn&#353;i&#263;, the genial official,
and Maister, they were informed by the latter that he was
a General&mdash;he looks like a swarthy Viking&mdash;and they
were asked to surrender their swords. As they did not
know how many men the General had behind him&mdash;as a
matter of fact he had nine&mdash;they acted on his suggestion;
one of them wept as he did so. At 11 a.m. Lajn&#353;i&#263; deposed
all the chief civil officials in that part of Styria, and the
General persuaded the 47th Regiment to leave by train.
They were influenced by a notice in the papers which said
that 100,000 Frenchmen (invented by the General and
Lajn&#353;i&#263;) had just arrived at Ljubljana. After this the
two companions carried on at Maribor; very little was
known of them for a month at Ljubljana, Zagreb or
Belgrade. But then they were confirmed in the posts
they had assumed and Maister became a regular General.
They were not intolerant; they expelled less than ten
people, although so many of the German-Austrians had
come, under the auspices of the S&uuml;dmark Verein (a
colonization society) or the Deutsche Schulverein (an
educational body), to propagate Germanism. One of
these colonists, a doctor, who had lived a dozen years
in Maribor, could only say "Good morning" in Slovene;
and German women in the market-place (themselves
unable to speak proper German) used to insist on the
Slovene peasants speaking a language of which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
knew scarcely a word. Lajn&#353;i&#263; and Maister took no
steps against the Bishop of Maribor who, three months
after the Austrian collapse, celebrated a Mass in honour
of the ex-Emperor. This Bishop, the son of Slovene
peasants, had been educated near Vienna, had been a
confessor of the House of Habsburg, and he found it
difficult to regard himself as a Slovene. Gradually the
voice of his own people spoke in him and then, after very
long and honourable mental conflict, he developed into
an excellent Yugoslav. He and Maister are, both of them,
poets. Most of the General's pieces&mdash;which are all in
Slovene&mdash;treat of love and nature. But he wrote at
least one set of other verses, which the Austrians suppressed
during the War. This is the nearest translation
I can make of them:</p>

(July 8, 1920), it is fairer to describe Mr. Trevelyan as an Italian exponent
rather than apologist. Although we cannot agree with various remarks
of his, he makes it clear that he is out of sympathy with the Italian
extremists. He deprecates also the views of those English publicists
who are altogether on the side of the Yugoslavs. "The truth, perhaps,"
says he, "lies somewhere hid in the centre." And if that is not a very
happy observation, it is at any rate much more moderate than the average
views of those English writers whose spiritual home is in Italy.</p></div>

one must mention the transactions of a Podgorica merchant, M. Buri&#269;,
and his partners, who sold 150,000 kilos of grain to the retreating army at
cost price, that is, at one dinar per kilo when they could have obtained
five. Two million kilos of hay they sold at 8 paras per kilo instead of at 50
or more. There were at this time only 20 tons of flour in all Montenegro.
Undoubtedly the refusal of Buri&#269; and his friends to profit from the distress
of their brother Serbs was much more typical of the Montenegrins than
the conduct which Nikita drew forth from the weak side of their
character.</p></div>

these priests, Dr. Alexius U&#353;eni&#269;nik, Professor of Theology, published at
Ljubljana a little book packed with ancient and modern quotations from
Latin and French, Italian and German sources. He called it <i>Um die
Yugoslavija; Eine Apologie</i>; and in the strongest terms he combated
the reproach that the Slovene bishop, the clergy and the people were
not loyal to the Habsburgs. Dr. U&#353;eni&#269;nik proved that the poor Slovenes
were suffering an almost intolerable subjection at the hands of the Germans,
but he persisted in demanding nothing more than freedom within the
Habsburg Monarchy. "The Monarchy," said our unhappy author, "is
in the midst of its development." And this priest, who was so deaf to
the grand Yugoslav idea, quoted with approval the words of Gustave
le Bon: "Ideas take a long time in possessing the people's soul."</p></div>
